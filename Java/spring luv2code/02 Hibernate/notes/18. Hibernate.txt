What is Hibernate?
	> A framework for persisting / saving Java objects in a database

Benefits of Hibernate
	> Hibernates handles all of the low-level SQL
	> Minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop
	> Hibernate provides the Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)


Object-To-Relational Mapping (ORM)
	> The developer defines mapping between Java class and database table


SAVING A JAVA OBJECT WITH HIBERNATE
	
// create Java object
Student theStudent = new Student("John", "Doe", "john@luv2code.com");

// save it to database
int theId = (Integer) session.save(theStudent);


RETRIEVING A JAVA OBJECT WITH HIBERNATE

// now retrieve from database using the primary key
Student myStudent = session.get(Student.class, theId);



QUERYING FOR JAVA OBJECTS

Query query = session.createQuery("from Student");
List<Student> students = query.list();



Hibernate and JDBC
	> Hibernate uses JDBC for all database communications
