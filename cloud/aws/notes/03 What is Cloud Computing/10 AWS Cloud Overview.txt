AWS Global Infrastructure:
 > consist of the following:
	1. AWS Region
	2. AWS Availability Zones
	3. AWS Data Centers
	4. AWS Edge Locations / Point of Presence




AWS Regions
 > AWS has Regions all around the world
 > A Region is a cluster of data centers
 > Most AWS services are region-scoped
 > Each Region have their own code
	- ex: US East (N. Virginia) is us-east-1 and US East (Ohio) is us-east-2




Criteria for Choosing an AWS Region
1. Complieance with data governance and legal requirements
	> ex: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
2. Proximity to customer
	> the closer the data center to users, the less latency they will face when using your apps
3. Available services within a Region
 	> new services and new features aren't available in every Region 
4. Pricing
	> pricing of service varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page





AWS Availability Zones
 > Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min, 2, max is 6)
 > ex:
	- ap-souteast-2a
	- ap-souteast-2b
	- ap-souteast-2c
 > Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
 > They are separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters
 > They are connected with HIGH bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking





AWS Pointes of Presence (Edge Locations)
 > Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge locations & 11 Regional Caches) in 84 cities across 42 countries
 > Responsible for deliverying Content to end users with lowest latency as possible
