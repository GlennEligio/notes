04.02. Components - Cards

Cards
	> A card is a flexible and extensible content container. 
	> It includes options for
		- headers and footers, 
		- a wide variety of content, 
		- contextual background colors, and 
		- powerful display options. 
	> If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.


Creating Card
	> to create a Card, we will need to have a div with class "card"
	> inside the "card" element, we can need several elements/components with classes like


Class hierarchy when creating Card Component of Bootstrap
> "card"
	> "card-header"
	> "card-body"
		> "card-img-top"
		> "card-title"
		> "card-text"
	> "card-footer"


"card"
	> class in Bootstrap to make an element (mostly div) look like a card	
	> gives some properties as well like
		- display: flex and flex-direction: column
		- light gray 1px border
		- border radius of 0.25rem

"card-header"
	> represents the header of the card
	> properties include
		- gray background
		- top/bottom padding 0.5rem, left/right padding 1rem
		- 1px gray bottom border

"card-footer"
	> represents the footer of card
	> same properties as "card-header"
	> typically used with "text-muted"
		-> text-muted makes the text less opaque

"card-body"
	> represents the body of the card
	> contains the content of the card
	> have the following properties
		-> flex: 1 1 auto
		-> padding of 1rem in all sides

"card-title"
	> represents the title of the card's body
	> properties include
		-> bottom margin 0.5rem

"card-text"
	> represents the text content of card's body
	> properties include
		-> last child will have margin bottom of 0

"card-img"
"card-img-top"
"card-img-bottom"
	> represents the image inside card's body
	> properties include
		-> width: 100%
		-> 0.25rem top-left and top-right border radius
			=> only in card-img and card-img-top
		-> 0.25rem bottom-left and bottom-right border radius
			=> only in card-img and card-img-bottom




Sizing of Cards
	> by default, the Card will take ALL the space available in the screen (width:100%)
	> to prevent this, we will need to define the size of the Card
	> instead of specifying the size of the element with "card", we will instead do it in the element that NEST the Card

ex: 
<div class="col-2">
	<div class="card">
		<!-- Card content here -->
	</div>
</div>

	> there are several ways to do the sizing of the Card
		1. Using grid markup
			-> adding "col" class in the element that nest the Card
			-> ex: <div class="col-2">
		2. Using utilities
			-> using Width and Height utilities in the "card" element
			-> ex: <div class="card w-50">
		3. Using custom CSS in the "card" element
			-> <div class="card" style="width:18rem">



Creating Card Groups
	> card groups is used to group up Card
	> in Card group, all Cards under it will
		-> occupy all WIDTH (total width of Cards = total width available in parent container)
		-> all Cards will have SAME WIDTH and HEIGHT
	> to create a card group, we will need to use the class "card-group"

"card-group"
	> used to group Cards
	> added in the element that nest the "card" elements

EX:
<div class="card-group">
	<div class="card">
	</div>
	<div class="card">
	</div>
	<div class="card">
	</div>
</div>





Creating List Group
	> we can create a list of Card items/contents stack VERTICALLY with "list-group"
		-> for horizontal List Group, use "list-group-horizontal"
	> for the items inside the List Group, we will need to add "list-group-item" class to them

Hierarchy
> "card"
	> "list-group"
		> "list-group-item"


"list-group"
	> used to group items (ex. Card content) VERTICALLY
	> properties include
		- display: flex; flex-direction: column

"list-group-item"
	> represents an item in List groups
	> properties include:
		- display: block; grayish border; top-bottom padding 0.5rem; left-right padding 1rem


EX:
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item">An item</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">A second item</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">A third item</li>
  </ul>
</div>





Horizontal Card
	> in a horizontal Card, the card image and card body is arranged horizontally instead of default vertically
	> to do this, we will do several steps
		1. Create a "card" element
		2. Create a "row" element inside the Card
			-> this element must have "g-0" class to remove the gutter at the sides
		3. Create two "col" elements inside the row
			-> one for nesting the img
				=> must have "card-img" class or at least width:100% to occupy the whole column
			-> one for nesting the card-body

EX:
<div class="col-6">
	<div class="card">
		<div class="row g-0">
			<div class="col-4">
				<img src="someImage.jpg" class="card-img-top"/>
			</div>
			<div class="col-8">
				<div class="card-body">
					<!-- Some content -->
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</>




Styling Cards
	> we can use the Bootstrap Utilities for applying text, background, and border color
		-> ex: "text-white" "text-dark" "bg-primary" "bg-warning" "border-info"
	> we typically apply these Bootstrap Utility classed in "card" element
		-> if we do this, all element nested inside the Card will INHERIT the said properties

EX:
        <div class="col-3">
          <div class="card text-white bg-primary mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem">
            <div class="card-header">Header</div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <h5 class="card-title">Primary card title</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
                the bulk of the card's content.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

In this example, we can see the "text-white" and "bg-primary" being used to style the card's text and background color


          <div class="card border-primary mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem">
            <div class="card-header">Header</div>
            <div class="card-body text-primary">
              <h5 class="card-title">Primary card title</h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up
                the bulk of the card's content.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

In this example, we can see the "border-primary" in Card and "text-primary" in Card body
