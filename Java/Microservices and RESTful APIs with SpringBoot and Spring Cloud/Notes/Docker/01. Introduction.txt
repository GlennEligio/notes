01. Introduction

MicroServices
	> enterprises are heading towards microservices architectures
	> consist of building SMALL focused microservices

Advantage
1. Flexibility to innovate and build applications in different programming languages
	- Go, Java, Python, JavaScript, etc


Problem:
Creating Deployment Strategy for each microservices built with different programming languages

Solution:
Containers



Docker
	> one of the examples of Container Solution
	> with this, we can create Docker Images for each microservice
	> Docker images contains everything a microservice needs to run:
		- Application Runtime (JDK or Python or NodeJS)
		- Application code
			=> .jar file for Spring Boot / Java apps
		- Dependencies
	> You can run these docker containers in THE SAME WAY on any infrastructure
		- in local machine
		- in Corporate data center
		- in Cloud
