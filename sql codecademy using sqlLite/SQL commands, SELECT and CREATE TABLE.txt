SELECT, CREATE TABLE Commands

SQL COMMANDS/CLAUSES
	> Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL
	> By convention, clauses are written in capital letters

SELECT
	> used to select a column and row in a table

FROM
	> used to select the table where the SELECT command will be applied

EX:
	 SELECT * FROM celebs; 

This line/statement will:
	> Select everything, which is denoted by symbol "*", inside the "celebs" table


CREATE TABLE
	> used to create a table inside a database
	> the naming convention of CREATE TABLE is

CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);

where in:
CREATE TABLE 
	> clause
table_name 	
	> refers to the name of table that the command is applied to
(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type)
	> parameters, contains columns, data types, or values that are paased to a caluse as an argument

EXAMPLE:

 CREATE TABLE celebs(
   id INTERGER,
   name TEXT,
   age INTEGER
 );

Here, we create a table named "celebs". Then we created columns and its corresponding datatypes (id with INTEGER datatype, name with TEXT datatype, age with INTEGER datatype).
