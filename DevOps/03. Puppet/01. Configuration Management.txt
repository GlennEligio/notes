01. Configuration Management

Configuration
	> includes resources of Server like
		a. Installation of software
		b. Users
		c. Files
	> changing the default state of operating system


Configuration Management (CM)
	> CM is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.
	> CM can be divided into TWO models
		1. Pull based models
		2. Push based models
	> Configuration Management tools tend to implement one (or both) of these models of management.
	> These are the ways a given configuration management tool actually "does the things" it has to do, like
		- installing packages
		- writing files
		- adding users


Push based Model
	> Centralized server (Master) PUSHES the configurations on the nodes
	> Examples are Ansible, Terraform


Pull based Model
	> Node / Client Server PULLS the configurations from the Master Server
	> example is Puppet
