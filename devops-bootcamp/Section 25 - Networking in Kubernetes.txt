Section 25 - Networking in Kubernetes
141. Basics of Networking in Kubernetes

Kubernetes Networking - 101
 > IP Address is assigned to a Pod, unlike in Docker where it is assigned to Containers
 > When K8s is intially configured, we create an internal private network with the address 10.244.0.0, and all the Pods are attached to this private network
	- ex:
		INTERNAL PRIVATE NETWORK - 10.244.0.0
		POD1 - 10.244.0.4
		POD2 - 10.244.0.3
		POD3 - 10.244.0.2
		
		
Cluster Networking
 > when the K8s cluster is setup, K8s DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY SETUP any kind of networking
 > when creating a K8s cluster with one or more Nodes present, the K8s expects us to setup a networking solution that meets the criteria below
	1. All containers/PODs can communicate to one another without NAT
	2. All nodes can communicate with all containers and vice-versa without NAT
 > thankfully, there are multiple pre-built solution available, which includes:
	- Cisco AC Networks
	- Psyllium
	- Big Cloud Fabric
	- Flannel
	- VMware NSX-T
	- TT
	- Calico
 > when setting up Kubernetes cluster from the scratch in our own system, we can use any of the solutions like Calico, or Flannel, etc
 > if we are deploying on a VMware environment, vmware NSX-T might be a good option
 > Play with K8s labs website uses Weave Net as their networking solution
 
 
Without Cluster Networking setup
 > with this setup, the NODE1 and NODE2 will have the same private internal ip address
 > here, there is a chance of ip conflict, wherein a Pod in NODE 1 and NODE 2 will have the same ip address assign which can cause issues

NODE 1											NODE 2
192.168.1.2										192.168.1.3

10.244.0.0 	----> SAME INTERNAL NETWORK IP <---- 10.244.0.0
	|												|
	V												V
POD												POD
10.244.0.2										10.244.0.2



With Cluster Networking setup
 > with Calico handling the routing between the private internal ip networks of Node 1 and Node 2, we can fulfill the Network requirements of Kubernetes clusters

NODE 1							NODE 2
192.168.1.2						192.168.1.3

10.244.0.0 	----> ROUTING <---- 10.244.1.0
