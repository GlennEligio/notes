61 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Using AutoFS with NFS


Prerequisite for AutoFS
1. NFS Client and Server sharing the same network
2. /etc/exports that is configured to share the home directory of a user
3. Client must have "autofs" installed
	> check if you already have one install using systemctl status
4. UserId AND GroupId of both the user in Client and user that shares the homedir must match
	> user in Client will follow the user with NFS server's userid and groupid
5. If id of user in Client is modified, modify the ownership of all the files that is owned by the said user
	> usermod doesnt handle userid updates in the files/folders



Setting up the NFS Server for AutoFS
1. Add the "/home" directory in the /etc/exports to be used by Client with AutoFS
	> $ vi /etc/exports
	> add "/home 10.0.2.4(rw,no_root_squash)"
		- check NFS section to see that this means
2. Restart nfs-server service
	> $ systemctl restart nfs-server.service
	> $ systemctl status nfs-server.service


Setting up NFS Client for AutoFS
NOTES: In this example, the userid:groupid of server = 1005:1007, the userid:groupid of client = 1001:1001
1. Check if the users IDs between the NFS server and client are the same using "id"
	> $ id user1	in NFS server
	> $ id user1	in NFS Client
2. If not the same, use usermod command to make their userid and groupids match
	> $ usermod -u 1005 user1		executed in client, to match the one in server
	> $ usermod -g 1007 user1		executed in client as well
3. Change the user and group ownership of the files/folder of the user (user1 in this case)
	> this is due to the usermod not updating the file/folder owned by the modified user
	> $ for i in `file / -user 1001`; do chown 1005 $i; done
	> $ for i in `file / -group 1001`; do chgrp 1007 $i; done
4. Install autofs if its still not available in system
	> $ dnf install autofs
	> $ systemctl status autofs
	> $ systemctl start autofs
5. Configure the autofs, first point autofs to our autofs.home file
	> $ vi /etc/auto.master.d/home.autofs
	> add the following line 
		/home		/etc/autofs.home
6. Create a new /etc/autofs.home with the actual configuration of autofs
	> $ vi /etc/autofs.home
	> add the line below
		*	-rw	10.0.2.15:/home/&
7. Enable and restart autofs
	> $ systemctl restart autofs
	> $ systemctl enable autofs


Testing the AutoFS
1. In client, login as the user used (user1) and create a file in /home/user1 
	> $ touch fromclient
2. In server, check the file created in the same directory
	> $ ls -lhtra /home/user1
3. In server as well, create a file in /home/user1
	> $ touch fromserver
4. In client, check the /home/user1 for the file
	> $ ls -lhtra /home/user1
5. Check the user and group ownership of the files created
	> the user and group ownership must match from the "ls -lhtra" output in both server and client
