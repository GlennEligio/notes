CloudWatch Logs for EC2
 > By default, NO logs from your EC2 instance will go to CloudWatch
 > You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push log files you want from EC2 / On premise servers to the Cloudwatch log service
 > Make sure that EC2 has the correct IAM permissions in order to send logs into the CloudWatch Logs
 > The CloudWatch log agent can ALSO be setup on-premsises too
