13 Audience Q&A on Reactive Sources

NOTES:
1. Flux is agnostic when it comes to emitting and executing subcribed behaviors
	> it depends on what Flux implementation is being used
2. In Reactive programming model, it hides what happens underneath, specifically on how
	> reactive source knows that it data is changed
	> reactive source emits the element
	> subscriber executes its behavior on the emitted element
3. If multiple subscription on a specific stream exist, the execution of the subscription is random, not deterministic, and no pattern
4. Flux works like a publisher, and all that subscribed to it will receive its emitted element
