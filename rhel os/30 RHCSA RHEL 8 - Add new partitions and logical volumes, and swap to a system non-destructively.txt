30 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Add new partitions and logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively


swap
 > using the system disk to provide additional memory or ram
 > if the system rans out of the memory, it will use the storage space that is previous assigned to as "swap" to use as addition to the memory

GOAL:
1. Create Logical Volume and assign it as swap


Add Logical Volume as swap
1. Create logical volume
	$ lvcreate -L 2G -n swap1 vg1
2. Setup a swap area for the logical volume
	$ mkswap /dev/vg1/swap1
3. Add the logical volume in the "etc/fstab" by adding the line below
	/dev/vg1/swap1	swap	swap	defaults	0 0
4. Enable swapon to the logical volume
	$ swapon -a			for all devices
	$ swapon /dev/vg1/swap1	for single device	
5. Verify if swapon worked, there should be a swap area that matches the size of the logical volume
	$ swapon -s


Commands:
mkswap
 > setup a Linux swap area
 > syntax:
	$ mkswap [options] DEVICE [SIZE]
 > EX:
	$ mkswap /dev/vg1/swap1


swapon, swapoff
 > enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping
 > sypnosis
	$ swapon [option] [specialfile...]
	$ swapoff [-va] [specialfile...]
 > option
	-s 	display swap usage summary by device
 > ex:
	$ swapon /dev/vg1/swap1
		> enable swapping for the /dev/vg1/swap1 LV
	$ swapon -s
		> list swap usage summary by device
