09. Conditional operators and flow

X. Conditional operators

Greater than (>)
Less than (<)
Equals operand (==)
Greater than or equal (>=)
Less than or equal (<=)

Strict equal operands (===)
	> used to compare variables or values
	> unlike equal operand (==), String equal also checks the DATATYPE of the values being compared
		- if same value but different datatype, will return false

EX:
// Strict equal operand

const x = 20;

if (x === 10) {
  console.log("x is 10");
} else if (x > 10) {
  console.log("x is greater than 10");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than 10");
}


AND operator (&&)
	> checks if two conditions are BOTH true
	> if BOTH true, returns true. else return false

OR operator (||)
	> check if at least ONE condition is true
	> if at least ONE condition is true, returns true
	> else, return false

EX:
const x = 20;
const y = 10;

if (x > 10 && y > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 10 AND y is greater than 5");
} 
if (x < 10 || y == 10) {
  console.log("x is less than 10 OR y is equal to 10");
}


Switch
	> used to compare a single variable to different values
	> more efficient that if-else in cases where we use single variable for multiple cases
	> composes of 
		- variable
		- multiple cases
		- default case

EX:
// Switch
switch (x) {
  case 20:
    console.log("x is 20");
  case 10:
    console.log("x is 10");
}
