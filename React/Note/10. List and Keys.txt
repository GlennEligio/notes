10. List and Keys

List and Keys
	> we sometimes use Arrays to populate a UI
	> using map() of Array, we transform each of the item into a JSX
	> some of these JSX needs to be tracked for changes (ex: Components) while other do not (ex: normal HTML tags like h1, li, etc)
		- for these, we will use Keys
	> Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
		- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
		- ex: id attribute of an element

EX:
// For Array.map() to create JSX that doesnt need Keys
const Tasks = ({ tasks }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <h3>{task.text}</h3>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Tasks;


// For Array transform that needs Keys for tracking
import Task from "./Task";

const Tasks = ({ tasks }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {tasks.map((task) => (
        <Task key={task.id} task={task} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Tasks;
