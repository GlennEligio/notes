Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker
 > recommended to use official 'jenkins/jenkins' image from Docker Hub repository
 
On macOS and Linux
1. Open up a terminal windows
2. Create a bridge network in Docker using the following docker network create command
	$ docker network create jenkins
3. In order to execute Docker commands inside Jenkins nodes, download and run the 'docker:dind' Docker image using the following docker run command below:

docker run \
  --name jenkins-docker \	1
  --rm \	2
  --detach \	3
  --privileged \	4
  --network jenkins \	5
  --network-alias docker \	6
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \	7
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \	8
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \	9
  --publish 2376:2376 \	10
  docker:dind \	11
  --storage-driver overlay2	12
  
	1. (Optional) Specifies the Docker container name to use for running the image. By default, Docker generates a unique name for the container
	2. (Optional) Automatically removes the Docker container (instance of the Docker image) when it is shut down
	3. (Optional) Runs the Docker container in the background. You can stop this instance by running 'docker stop jenkins-docker' command
	4. Running Docker in Docker currently requires privileged access to function properly. This requirement may be relaxed with newer Linux kernel versions
	5. This corresponds with the network created in the earlier step
	6. Makes the Docker in Docker container available as the hostname docker within the jenkins network
	7. Enables the user of TLS in the Docker server. Due to the user of a privileged container, this is recommended, though it requires the user of the shared volume described below. This environment variable controls the root directory where Docker TLS certificates are managed
