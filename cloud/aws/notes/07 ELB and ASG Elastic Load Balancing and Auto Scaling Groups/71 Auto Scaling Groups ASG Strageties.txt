71 Auto Scaling Groups ASG Strageties

Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Strategies
1. Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
2. Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
 > Simple/Step Scaling
	- ex: When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
	- ex: When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
 > Target Tracking Scaling
	- ex: I want to average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
 > Scheduled Scaling
	- Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
	- ex: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays
3. Predictive Scaling
 	> Uses Machine Learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
	> Automatically provisions the right number of EC2 instance in advance
	> Useful when your load has predictable time-based patterns
