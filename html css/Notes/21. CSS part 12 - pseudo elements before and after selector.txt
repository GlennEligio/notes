21. CSS part 12 - pseudo elements ::before and ::after 

includes:
::before
::after

::before
	> The ::before selector inserts something before the content of each selected element(s).
	> Use the content property to specify the content to insert.
	> we can also define other CSS property inside this selector
		- the CSS property will modify the content we pass in ::before selector

::after
	> The ::after selector inserts something after the content of each selected element(s).
	> Use the content property to specify the content to insert. 
	> we can also define other CSS property inside this selector
		- the CSS property will modify the content we pass in ::after selector


NOTES:
1. content property is MANDATORY for ::before and ::after to work
	> must pass at least an empty string ""
2. ::before and ::after DOES NOT WORK with img elements
	> theory behind this is that the image we inside is the Content itself
	> to remedy this, 
		a. we can insert the img inside a div
		b. make the img responsive
			= width is 100% (whole width of div container)
			= display is block (to occupy the whole div container height)
