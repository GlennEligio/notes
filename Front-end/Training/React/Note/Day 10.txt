Redux


Adding Debugger in Redux
1. Add debugger; 
	1. in reducers.js and 
	2. in mapStateToProps() function


With debugger;, we can see the flow of the Redux
1. It first goes to the reducers.js to determine the State to send to mapStateToProps()
	- the state return will be the new State in the Centralized Data in Redux
2. The mapStateToProps then receives the State returned by reducers.js and maps it to a certain Property




HTML5 new features

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
Your browser does not support the HTML canvas tag.</canvas>

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(95,50,40,0,2*Math.PI);
ctx.stroke();
</script> 

</body>
</html>
