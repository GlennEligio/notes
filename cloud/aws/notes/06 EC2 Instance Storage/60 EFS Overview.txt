60 EFS Overview


EFS - Elastic File System
 > Managed and Shared NFS (network file system) that can mounted on multiple (up to 100s) EC2
 > EFS works ONLY with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
 > Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x of gp2 EBS), pay per use, no capacity planning
	- if you only use specific amount of storage (ex: 20gb), then thats only what you will be paying


EX: EFS mounted to multiple EC2 (different AZ) 
us-east-1a	us-east-1b	us-east-1c
EC2 instances	EC2 instances	EC2 instances

EBS vs EFS
 > with EBS, you need to need to use Snapshots in order to transfer data from different EC2 instances of different AZs
 > with EFS, any EC2 instances can access (read/write) to an EFS using EFS Mount Target
	- each EC2 instances will see the same files



EFS Infrequence Access (EFS-IA)
 > Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not being accessed every day
 > Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
 > EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
 > Enable EFS-IA with Lifecycle Policy
	- similar to Recycle Bin's Retention Policy
 > EX: Move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA
 > Transparent to applications accessing EFS
	- application will not be aware of the EFS-IA at all


EX:
EFS
 > EFS Standard
	> File1
	> File2
	> File3 (not accessed by 60 days, will be moved to EFS-IA)
 > EFS-IA
	> File3 (still accessible to other applications)
