08 What is Cloud Computing


What is Cloud Computing
 > Cloud computing is the ON-DEMAND delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
 > Through a cloud services platform with PAY-AS-YOU-GO pricing
	- this means you are only paying for the resources you use
 > You can PROVISION EXACTLY the right type and size of computing resources you need
	- refers to as ELASTICITY of the resources
 > You can access as many resources as you need, ALMOST INSTANTLY
 > Simple way to access SERVERS, STORAGE, DATABASES, and a set of APPLICATION SERVICES
	- provides a GUI to interacts with these resources
 > AWS owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application



Examples of Cloud services
Gmail
 > email cloud service
 > pay for only your emails storaged (no infrastructure, etc)
Dropbox
 > Cloud Storage Service
 > Originally built on AWS
Netflix
 > Built on AWS
 > Video on Demand



Deployment Models of the Cloud
1. Private Cloud
 > Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
 > Complete control
 > Security is emphasized for sensitive application
 > Meets the specific business needs
 > EX: rackspace

2. Public Cloud
 > Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
 > EX: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google GCP

3. Hybrid Cluod
 > Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
 > Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
 > Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
 > typically seen in a 



FIVE Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. On-demand self service:
 > Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
2. Broad network access:
 > Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
3. Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
 > Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
 > Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
4. Rapid elasticity and scalability
 > Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
 > Quickly and easily scale based on demand
5. Measured service:
 > Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used




SIX ADVANTAGES of Cloud Computing
1. Trade Capital Expense (CapEx) for Operational Expense (OpEx)
 > Pay On-Demand: pay for hardware resource you RENT
 > Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OpEx)
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
 > Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
 > Their savings from efficiency trickles down to the customers
3. Stop guessing capacity
 > we can scale based on actualy measured usage
 > unlike on-prem datacenter where you need to estimate the scalability
4. Increase speed and agility 
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes
 > can serve applications globally by leveraging the AWS global infrastructure
 > useful for startups




Problems solved by the Cloud
Flexibility
 > we can change resource types when needed
Cost-Effectiveness
 > pay as you go, for what you used
Scalability
 > accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
Elasticity
 > ability to scale out and scale in when needed
High availability and fault tolerance
 > build across data centers through Availability Zones
Agility
 > rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
