117 Lambda Overview

Why AWS Lambda - Amazon Lambda vs EC2
Amazon EC2
 > Virtual Servers in the Cloud
 > Limited by RAM and CPU
 > Continuously running
 > Scaling means intervention to add/remove servers


Amazon Lambda
 > Virtual functions - no servers to manage!
 > Limited by time - intended short executions
 > Run on-demand, the Lambda function will only run when demanded
 > Scaling is automated as part of Lambda service



Benefits of AWS Lambda
1. Easy Pricing
	> pay per request and compute time
	> free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
2. Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
3. Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
	> make the AWS Lambda REACTIVE
4. Integrated with many programming languages
5. Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
6. Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!)
7. Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!	



AWS Lambda language support
1. Node.js (JavaScript)
2. Python
3. Java (Java 8 compatible)
4. C# (.NET Core)
5. Golang
6. C# / Powershell
7. Ruby
8. Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust)
9. Lambda Container image
	> the container image specifically MUST implement the Lambda Runtime API
	> ECS/Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images



Example: Serverless Thumbnail creation
						push
						|------> S3 
       	trigger					|  (Stores new thumbnail)
S3	--------> AWS Lambda Function ----------|
(New image	(Creates a Thumbnail)		|
in S3 is					|-----> DynamoDB
added)						push	(Stores metadata of
							Thumbnail)



Example: Serverless CRON Job

			Trigger every 1 hour
CloudWatch Events -----------------------------> AWS Lambda Function
EventBridge					(Perform a Task)



AWS Lambda Pricing: Example
 > You can find the overall pricing information here:
	- https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/
 > Pay per calls:
	- First 1,000,000 requests are free
	- $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
 > Pay per duration: (in increment of 1ms)
	- 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month if FREE
	- == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB ram
	- == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128MB ram
	- After that, $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
 > It is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda so its very popular
