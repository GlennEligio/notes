@media
	> CSS rule that is used to apply different styles for different media types/devices
	> media queries can be used to check many things, such us
		1. width and height of the viewport
		2. width and height of the device
		3. orientation (landscape or portrait mode)
		4. resolution
	> media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tables, and mobile phones
	> @media queries contains CSS Selectors to define the design of the website



CSS Syntax

@media not|only mediatype and (mediafeature and|or|not mediafeature) {
	CSS-Code;
}

Keywords
not
	> not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query
only
	> only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the specifies styles
	> has NO EFFECT on modern browsers
and
	> the and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features



mediaTypes
1. all
	> default
	> used for all media type devices
2. print
	> used for printers
3. screen
	> used for computer screens, table, smart-phone, etc
4. speech
	> used for screenreaders



Some of the mediafeatures
1. min-width(em|rem|x%)
	> check for the width of the viewport
	> if viewport's width is GREATER than min-width, the media query will apply
2. min-height()
	> same as min-width but for height
3. max-width()
	> check for the width fo viewport
	> if the viewport's width is LESS THAN the max-width, the media query will not apply
4. orientation
	> check for orientation of device
	> takes either landscape or portrait value




NOTES:
1. These keywords are OPTIONAL.
2. If you use not or only, you MUST also specify a media type
3. If we notice, we have AND operator but not OR operator. If we want to add another mediafeature set to check for mediaquery application, we can use comma (,) to separate them


EX:
/* When the width is between 600px and 900px OR above 1100px - change the appearance of <div> */
@media screen and (max-width: 900px) and (min-width: 600px), (min-width: 1100px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 50px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 8px solid black;
    background: yellow;
  }
}


4. Last Rule Order applies in media queries
	> If a website features satisfies TWO mediaqueries, 
		a. In cases where these two mediaqueries have THE SAME CSS PROPERTY defined, the LATEST mediaquery will take effect
		b. As for the rest of CSS properties, ALL of them will take effect





Using <link> to use different CSS Stylesheet for different media
EX:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 900px)" href="widescreen.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" href="smallscreen.css">
