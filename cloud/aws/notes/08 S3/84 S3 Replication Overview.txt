84 S3 Replication Overview

S3 Replication (CRR & SRR)
 > must have versioning ENABLED in both source and destination buckets
 > two types of S3 Replication based on bucket locations
	1. Cross Region Replication (CRR)
	2. Same Region Replication (SRR)
 > the source and destination buckets can be in DIFFERENT accounts
 > copying is done ASYNCHRONOUSLY
 > must give proper IAM permissions to S3

Use Cases
CRR - Use cases:
 > compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
SRR - Use cases:
 > log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts


Ex:
