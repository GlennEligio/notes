04.1 Static Pods


Static Pods
	> Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them
	> Unlike Pods that are managed by control plane (ex: a Deployment), the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restart it if it fails)
	> Static Pods are always bound to one Kubelet on a specific node
	> The kubelet automatically tries to create a mirror Pod on the K8s API server for each static Pod
		- This means that the Posd running on a Node are visible on the API server, but cannot be controlled from there
	> The Pod names will be suffixed with the node host name with a leading hypen
		- ex: nginx-asda2123asd-node1

Creating Static Pod
1. Adhoc command
	kubectl run <POD NAME> --image <IMAGE>
2. Manifest file
	> kind must be "Pod"
  # Create a yaml file with below definition ( it is just an example)
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
     name: pod1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: c1
        image: nginx
