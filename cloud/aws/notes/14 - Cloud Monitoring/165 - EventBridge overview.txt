165 - EventBridge overview

EventBridge Overview
 > formerly CloudWatch Events
 > here, we can "watch" events, and "react" on these events
 > examples of these are
	1. Scheduled events: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
		- ex: Schedule every hour -> Trigger script on Lambda function
	2. Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something
		- ex: IAM Root User Sign in Event -> SNS Topic with Email notification
			-> we might do this since in pratice, we dont want to login using the IAM Root user
 > examples of the "reactions" to the events includes:
	- trigger Lambda functions
	- send SQS/SNS messages

EventBridge Event Buses
 > EventBridge uses Event buses to receive Events from different sources
 > There are THREE Event buses available
	1. Default event bus
		- Event going here are from the native AWS Services
	2. Partner Event bus
		- Events from AWS SaaS partners like zendesk and DATADOG uses this event bus
	3. Custom Event bus
		- Events from custom applications will be sending their events here
