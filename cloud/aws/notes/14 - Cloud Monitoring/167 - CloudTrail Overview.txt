167 - CloudTrail Overview

AWS CloudTrail
 > provides governance, compliance, and audit for your AWS Account 
 > CloudTrail is ENABLED by default
 > With this, you can get HISTORY OF EVENTS / API CALLS made within your AWS Account either by:
	- Console actions/activities
	- SDK usages
	- CLI commands
	- or any AWS Services
 > We can put the logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3 bucket for longer data / log retention
 > A trail can be applied to ALL REGIONS (DEFAULT) or a SINGLE REGION
 > EX: If a resource is deleted in AWS, we can investigate CloudTrail first
