Dynamic Config props in Spring Boot


Problem:
1. Config Clients need to restart to have their Config props from Config Server be updated as well


Solution
1. Use Spring Boot Actuator
	> In Spring Boot Actuator, theres an endpoint that is a hook
	> This endpoint's purpose is to be a hook for triggering config props refresh
	> To do this, we will need to send a POST request to the said endpoint




Steps
1. Add Spring Boot Actuator dependency
2. Expose all endpoints of Actuator

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"


3. Mark all classes and @Beans that have dependencies which uses Config Props
	-> mark with @RefreshScope

EX:
@Service
@RefreshScope
public class JwtUtil {

	// Fetch JWT in Config props
	@Value("${user-service.jwt}")
	private String SECRET_KEY;

}

4. Send a POST request to the /actuator/refresh
	> no need for body
	> will return a response of the config props updated
