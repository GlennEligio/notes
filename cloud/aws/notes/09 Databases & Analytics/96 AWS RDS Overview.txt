96 AWS RDS Overview


AWS RDS Overview
 > RDS stands for Relational Database
 > It is a managed DB service DB that uses SQL as a query language
 > It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
	- Postgres
	- MySQL
	- MariaDB	
	- Oracle
	- Microsoft SQL Server
	- Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)



Advantage over using RDS versus Deploying DB on EC2 instance
1. RDS is a managed service:
 > Automated provisioning, OS patching
 > Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps (Point in Time Restore)!
 > Monitoring dashboards
 > Read replicas for improved read performance
 > Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
 > Maintenance windows for upgrades
 > Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
 > Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)

NOTE:
1. You can't SSH into your instances

Amazon Aurora
 > Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
 > PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB
 > Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 
	- 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS over MySQL on RDS, 
	- over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
 > Aurora storage automatically grows in increment of 10GB, up to 64TB
 > Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient
 > Not in the free tier
