008 Sketching Tips

Sketching Tips
1. Dont worry about the sketches being messy
	> goal is to throw out as many idea as possible, refining them will come later
	> be lean, agile, sketch quickly and save time instead of worrying about the details
2. Think about the sketch as BUILDING BLOCKS
	> we can see all the items we added in sketchs a blocks, that we put together to make something more
	> ex: in home page, we can create it with components like carousel, search bar, nav bar, etc
3. Keep your sketches safe
	> save the sketches you made
	> we might revisit some of the sketches that you like or needed
4. Always be prepared
	> always keep a sketchpad or notebook near you
	> reason is that there might be an idea that pops into your head and having them can help you record and later revisit
5. Hang the sketches up so that they can easily be seen
	> if you have your sketches physically, hang them in a cardboard
	> if you have your sketches digital, display them in a separate monitor
	> this will make it easy to view them all instead of shifting through the sketchpad or browser/desktop tabs
	> other people can also easily see your sketches and may provide feedbacks on it
6. Communicate to other team members
	> designing, especially when youre in a team, is a collaborative process
	> with your team members, you can receive valuable external feedbacks that you can use to improve your sketches
	> example is when you want to implement a design feature, you might want to talk to a developer to discuss the feature feasibility
