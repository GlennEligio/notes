CHANGING SPECIFIC DATACELL / UPDATING DATAROW in a TABLE
	> in order to change a specific row in a table you need three thing
		a. call UPDATE command in a table
		b. SET the value(s) of the columns of that row(s)
		c. create a condition WHERE that will determine what specific row(s) it will apply the change

EXAMPLE:

 UPDATE celebs
 SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13'
 WHERE id = 4;

Here, we first called the UPDATE command in the "celebs" table, then we SET the data in each row(s) we want to update, then we will create a conditional WHERE in if a row met the conditional, it will apply the update in the SET command.
