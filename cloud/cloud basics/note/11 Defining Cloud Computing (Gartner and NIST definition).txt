11 Defining Cloud Computing (Gartner and NIST definition)


Cloud
 > "rent data center hardware"


Gartner's Definition of Cloud
 > widely cited definition
 > "Cloud computing is a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service using Internet technologies"

Key elements
1. Scalable
	> you can increase the capacity of application by providing resources
2. Elastic
	> elastic means the resources used is adaptable, based on the demand
	> example is increase and reduce the resources used in a server procured in Cloud whenever we want
3. Delivered as service
	> with On Prem, the resources is delivered physically, where you install the tangible servers to data center
	> with Cloud, you will be provided an interface, typically through Internet, in order to use their services



NIST 
 > National Institure of Standards in Technology
 
NIST's Definition of Cloud
 > pretty old definition
 > (Five) essential characteristics they define that needs to be applied to an architecture for it to be called a "Cloud"
 > Service models to be used to create the architecture
 > Deployment models to be used to have a proper Cloud computing infrastructure
