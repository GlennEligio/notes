73 ELB & ASG - Summary

High Availability
 > refers to the application/system having multiple instances across different region/AZ, which makes it available all the time
Scalability (vertical and horizontal)
 > refers to the ability of the application to scale in order to accomodate increasing load
Elasticity
 > refers to the ability to scale up and down based on the demand
Agility in Cloud
 > concept of the Cloud which make you work more agile because you can create and delete  resources quickly
Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
 > distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be multi-AZ
 > Support health checks
 > 3 types:
	- Application LB (HTTP - L7)
	- Network LB (TCP - L4)
	- Classic LB (old)
Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
 > implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
 > scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy
 > integrated with the ELB
	- we can use ELB to balance load between EC2 instances of ASG
