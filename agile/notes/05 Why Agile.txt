05 Why Agile?

Assumptions behind Predictive Model (ex: Waterfall)
1. We can predict the requiments accurately. It won't change much
	> if we predict requirement incorrectly, this will propagate down the line
	> in practice, they see that the customer/clients requirements changes from time to time, or that the market has shifted
2. Translation is going to be perfect
	> we assume that going from each stages like requirements -> design -> implementation will be smooth sailing
	> and the further down we find issue in the predictive model, the more costly the change is


Solutions provided by the different models created
1. Reduce the learning cycle by:
	- deliverying in short iterations
	- adapt based on what you learn
2. Keep the cost of change down by:
	- following engineering rigor
	- encouraging close collaboration among team members
