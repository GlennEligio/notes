NOTE:
1. In the exam, if a service needing a Chef or Puppet is mentioned, think of AWS OpsWork
2. OpsWorks architecture is similar to 3 tier application seen in the Elastic Beanstalk
3. The reason why you would use OpsWorks is when you are alreaady using Chef or Puppet and you are migrating to Cloud (AWS). We can re-use Chef or Puppet templates here
