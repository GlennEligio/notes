161 - CloudWatch Metrics & CloudWatch Alarms Overview


Amazon CloudWatch Metrics
 > CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS
 > Metric is a variable to monitor, it can be either
	- CPUUtilization
	- NetworkIn
	- etc
 > Metrics have TIMESTAMPS
 > With this, we can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics
 
 EX: CloudWatch Billing metrics
	> only available in us-east-1
	> with this, we can see the EstimatedCharges metrics, which shows the estimated total bill charge based on your Cloud services consumption
	> in this metric, it will show you a graph with the following variables as axis
		- X-axis = timeline (ex: every 30 days)
		- Y-axis = total estimated charge
		

Important Metrics
EC2 instances:
 > metrics that can be monitored includes:
	- CPU Utilization
	- Status Checks
	- Network
 > RAM/Memory is not included in the metrics
 > Default metrics for every 5 minutes
	- Option for Detailed Monitoring (metrics every 1 minute) is available but it cost more money
EBS Volumes:
 > metrics:
	- Disk Read
	- Disk Writes
S3 buckets:
 > metrics:
	- BucketSizeBytes
	- NumberOfObjects
	- AllRequests
Billing:
 > metrics
	- Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
Service Limits:
 > how much you've been using a service API
Custom metrics:
 > push your own metrics
 
 

Amazon CloudWatch alarms
 > Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metrics
 > Alarms actions are actions done when specific alarm is triggered and this includes but not limited to:
	- Auto Scaling: increase or decrease EC2 instances "desired" count
	- EC2 Actions: stop terminate, reboot, or recover an EC2 instance
	- SNS notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic
 > Various options to configure which includes:
	- sampling frequency of data
	- % like CPU utilization %, storage %, etc
	- max amount
	- min amount
	- etc
 > Can choose the period on which to evaluate an alarm as well
 > Alarms states includes:
	- OK: when everything is green
	- INSUFFICIENT_DATA: When theres not enough data samples to figure out if everything is green or bad
	- ALARM: when its bad, like the alarm is triggered or data is way past the alarm trigger configured
	
EX: Billing Alarm on the CloudWatch Billing metric
 > we can create an Alarm to notify us if our total estimated charges goes beyond a specify amount (ex: max amount = $10)
