14 Exam practice question


NOTES:
1. EC2 is a service provided by Amazon to handle compute workloads


Exam question
From AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam

Why is AWS more economical than traditional data centers for applications with varying compute workloads?
a. Amazon EC2 costs are billed on a monthly basis
b. Users retain full administrative access to their Amazon EC2 instances
c. Amazon EC2 instances can be launched on demand when needed
d. Users can permanently run enough instances to handle peak workloads


My Answer: C
Only this question relateds to the "varying compute workloads" since to sovle this, we will need to make sure that we can create/launch EC2 instances on demand based on the traffic.




Explanation for each items:
a. Amazon EC2 costs are billed on a monthly basis
	> this does not really relate to the varying compute workload as it is related more on the cost effectiveness
b. Users retain full administrative access to their Amazon EC2 instances
	> not related to making AWS more economical in terms of app with varying compute workload
	> related more on configuration flexibility and security
c. Amazon EC2 instances can be launched on demand when needed
	> fits perfectly to the problem of handling app with varying compute workload
d. Users can permanently run enough instances to handle peak workloads
	> we can do this in AWS, but it does not make it economical
	> also this will be similar to traditional data center
