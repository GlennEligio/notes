08 Query Rules - User Query Interpretation

Query Rules - User Query Interpretation
 > with Query Rules, we can interpret the user search query into another action to the search result
 > here are some of the example
	1. Showing cellphone instead of old phones when user searches for "phones"
	2. Showing headphones with price below $100 when user add "cheap" on top of "headphone" search query
	3. Showing headphones with ratings of 5 star when user add "best" on top of "headphone"
	
	
	
Showing cellphone instead of old phones when user searches for "phones"
1. Go to Indices panel
2. Go to Query rules
3. Add a new Query rules
4. In the Condition
	> set condition to "Contains"
	> pass "phone"
	> leave Context as is
5. In the Consequences
	> add new Consequence
	> select Add Query Parameter
	> pass the following json for query parameter
		- {"optionalFilters":"categories:Cell Phones"}
		- this will put the Algolia index record with attribute of "categories" equals to "Cell Phones" to the top of search result
6. Save the Query rule
7. With this, whenever we search in Algolia API with query keyword of "phone", we will see the Cell phones on top first



Showing headphones with price below $100 when user add "cheap" on top of "headphone" search query
1. Go to Indices panel
2. Go to Query rules
3. Add a new Query rules
4. In the Condition
	> set condition to "Contains"
	> pass "cheap"
	> leave Context as is
5. In the Consequences
	> add two Consequence
		1. One to use the query keyword cheap to create filter
		2. One to remove the "cheap" since there will be no matches if its present
	> select Add Query Parameter
	> pass the following json for query parameter
		- {"filters":"price < 100"}
		- this will put the Algolia index record with attribute of "price" less than 100 to the top of search result
	> add ANOTHER Consequence
	> select Remove word
	> pass "cheap" as the word to remove
6. Save the Query rule
7. With this, whenever we search in Algolia API with query keyword of "cheap" (ex: cheap headphone), we will see headphones whose price is less than 100



Showing headphones with ratings of 5 star when user add "best" on top of "headphone"
1. Go to Indices panel
2. Go to Query rules
3. Add a new Query rules
4. In the Condition
	> set condition to "Contains"
	> pass "best"
	> leave Context as is
5. In the Consequences
	> add two Consequences
		1. One to use the query keyword "best" to create filter
		2. One to remove the "cheap" since there will be no matches if its present
	> select Add Query Parameter
	> pass the following json for query parameter
		- {"filters":"rating = 5"}
		- this will put the Algolia index record with attribute of "rating" equal to 5 to the top of search result
	> add ANOTHER Consequence
	> select Remove word
	> pass "best" to the word to remove
6. Save the Query rule
7. With this, whenever we search in Algolia API with query keyword of "best" (ex: cheap headphone), we will see headphones whose rating is equal to 5


NOTE:
1. If there are two more Query rules in the Algolia index, they will get applied on top of each other, assumming that a Condition triggers both of the Query rules
	> ex: "best cheap headphone" will trigger the 2nd and 3rd query rule we created
