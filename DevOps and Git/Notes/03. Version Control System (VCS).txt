03. Version Control System (VCS)


Version Control System
	> VCS allows you to track the history of a collection of files
	> Each version captures a snapshot of the files at a certain point in time
	> VCS allows you to switch between these versions
	> two types
		1. Centralized Version Control System
		2. Distributed Version Control System


Centralized Version Control System
	> uses a CENTRAL SERVER to store all the files
	> every operations is performed DIRECTLY on the repository
	> in case the centra server crashes, entire data of the project will be LOST. 
		- hence, Distributed VCS was introduced

Distributed Version Control System
	> same as Centralized where it uses a Central Server
	> but here, every system has access to all the files
	> every programmer has a COPY of ALL the version of the code on their local system
	> Distributed VCS moves from client-server approarch of Central VCS to peer-to-peer approach
	> They can update their local repository with new data from central server AND changes gets reflected to the main repository
	> Git is one such Distributed VCS tool
