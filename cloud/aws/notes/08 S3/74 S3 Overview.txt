74 S3 Overview

Section Introduction
 > Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
 > It is advertised as 'infinitely scaling' storage
 > Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
 > Many AWS services uses Amazon S3 as an integration as well
 > We'll have a step-by-step approach to S3
 > The CCP exam require 'deeper knowledge' about S3


S3 Use cases
1. Backup and storage
2. Disaster Recovery
	> spread our data across different region using S3
3. Archive data
	> we can use some advanced tiering mechanism to do some cost saving to our archives 
4. Hybrid Cloud storage
5. Application hosting
6. Media hosting
7. Data lakes & big data analytics
8. Software delivery
9. Static websites


Companies that uses S3
1. Nasdaq - Nasdqaq stores 7 years of data into S3 Glacier
2. Sysco - Sysco runs analytics on its data and gain business insights



Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets
 > Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
 > Buckets must have a GLOBALLY UNIQUE NAME (across all region, all accounts)
 > Buckets are defined at the region level
 > S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a Region
 > Naming convention rules includes:
	- No uppercase
	- No underscore
	- 3-63 characters long
	- Not an IP
	- Must start with lowercase letter or number



Amazon S3 Overview - Objects
 > Objects (files) have a Key
 > The key is the FULL path:
	- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt 
		-> here, my_file.txt is the key
	- s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
		-> here, my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt is the key
 > The key is composed of prefix + object name
	- s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
		-> myfolder1/another_folder/ is the prefix
		-> my_file.txt is the object
 > There's no concept of 'directories' within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
 > They are just keys with very long names that contain slashes (/)
	- in some OS, slashes are NOT allowed in the filenames
 > Object values are the content of the body:
	- Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
	- If uploading more than 5GB, must use 'multi-part upload'
 > Metadata (list of text key/value pairs - system or user metadata)
 > Tags (Unicode key/value pair - up to 10)
	- useful for security/lifecycle
 > Version ID (if versioning is enabled)



NOTE:
1. With regards to Objects and Keys, you can think of them as files whose filenames contains slashes. Theres no directories behind the scene
