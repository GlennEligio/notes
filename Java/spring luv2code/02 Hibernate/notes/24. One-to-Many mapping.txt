One to Many Mapping

EXAMPLE:
	
An instructor can have many courses
	> Bi-directional

Many-to-One mapping
	> many courses can have one structor
	> inverse/opposite of One-To-Many

Real-World Project Requirement
1. If you delete an instructor, DO NOT delete the courses
2. If you delete a course, DO NOT delete the instructor
	> this means we will not add CascadeType.REMOVE to the mapping annotations
