03. Advantages of Microservices


Advantages of Microservices Architecture
1. Adaptability to new technologies and process
	> since microservices are built in REST style (using common communication technique, e.g. HTTP request), they can communicate with each regardless if these microservices are built using DIFFERENT technologies
	> Monolithic application would NOT have that flexibility when it comes to adapting new technologies in its system

EX:
Microservice 1 might be a Java Microservice
Microservice 2 might be a NodeJS
Microservice 3 might be written in Kotlin


2. Dynamic Scaling
	> we can easily scale the application in order to accomodate for different load/traffic for different time 
		- In Holiday seasons like Black Friday, there might be more load compare to the rest of the year.
		- With microservice, we can easily scale the Service up to accomodate to this increase in traffic then scale it down after the Black Friday


3. Faster Release Cycles
	> since the application is made up of smaller components, its much easier to release micro services compared to monolith application
	> we can also bring new features FASTER to market
