101 DynamoDB Hands On


Creating a Table
1. Search DynamoDB service
2. Go to the Tables section, then click Create
3. Pass the necessary info in Create Table form
	> name - 'DemoTable'
	> partition key - 'user id', serves similarly to a primary in SQL
4. Leave everything as is and create the Table


Creating Table Item
1. In Table dashboard, click 'Explore Table Items'
2. In the 'Items returned' section, click the Create item
3. In Create item page, pass the following attribute name - value pairs
4. Create the item


Demonstrating Item Schema Flexibility
1. Create another Item again
2. This time, use another set of attribute names
3. We should be able to create the Item even with different Item schema


Cleanup
1. Delete the Table


NOTES:
1. In DynamoDB, you dont create a Server, instead you are creating a Table
2. You can not link/join two different DynamoDB tables like in a Relation Database
3. Partition key is a part of the table's primary key. It is a hash value that is used to retrieve items from your table and allocate data across hosts for scalability and availability
4. Indepth knowledge with DynamoDB is outside the scope of Cloud Practitioner. Cloud Developer must know this though
