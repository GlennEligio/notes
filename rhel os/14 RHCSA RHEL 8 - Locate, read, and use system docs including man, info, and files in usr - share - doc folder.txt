14 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Locate, read, and use system docs including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc

/usr/share/info/
 > directory where all the content of the "info" command is stored

PATH
 > environment variable
 > contains a list of all the directories where the system will find the applications to run
 	- ex: if we run "ls", it will look to all directories in PATH for the "ls" script to run
 > to see the value of path, we can either
	1. print the "env" and use grep to filter with "PATH"
		- env | grep PATH
	2. print the PATH env directly
		- echo $PATH
 > EX: PATH=/home/jglenn/.local/bin:/home/jglenn/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
