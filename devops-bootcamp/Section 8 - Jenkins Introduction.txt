Section 8 - Jenkins Introduction

62. Application Details

App details
 > Go web application
 > Uses GORM as database backend
 > In the webapp, it will present a login page where we can login
 > Contains a Swagger documentation that we can examine

Application GitHub repo link
 > https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/go-webapp-sample




63. Working with the Application

Installing Go
 > in order to run the Go web application, we must have Go installed in the local machine

Cloning the repo
 > use the github repo to clone the repo on your local machine
 > github repo remote link: https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/go-webapp-sample.git
 > ex:
	git clone https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/go-webapp-sample.git
 
Things that we can do in the Application
1. Start the application
	> note that since we don't have the database setup, it will fail
	> $ go run main.go
2. Run all the test file inside the directory you are
	> in this case, we can run the test cases inside 'controller' directory
	> test files are the files taht ends with '_test.go'
	> note that we can only run the test files WHILE the application is running
	> ex:
		$ cd controller
		$ go test -v .
			- will run all the test files
	
	
Automating these processes
 > in our example, we are currently doing all of the steps MANUALLY, like starting up our Go application, then executing 'go test' to run the test files
 > if we have a CI solution like Jenkins setup, we can automate this steps by specifying all of the commands inside a Jenkins CI pipelines
 > one use case of CI pipeline is to run all the test like Unit test, Mock test, Integration test, etc
	
 



64. Get Familiar with the Application

Q1: In this lab, we will deploy the go-webapp-sample app that we saw in the lecture. This sample application uses Echo as web application framework and Gorm as the backend database.

Q2:Which of the following commands is used to clone a git repository?
A: git clone <repo-url>

Q3: Clone this git repository under /home/bob.
G: https://github.com/kodekloudhub/go-webapp-sample
S: 
0. Create the repo if it does not exist
	$ mkdir -p /home/bob
1. Go to /home/bob directory
	$ cd /home/bob
2. Clone the repo
	$ git clone https://github.com/kodekloudhub/go-webapp-sample.git
	
Q4: Now let us deploy the sample app from the repository that we just cloned. Run the following commands:
	$ cd /home/bob/go-webapp-sample/
	$ go run main.go &
S: Execute commands specify and wait until it indicates that the web app is running

Q5: You can now access the sample app using the Sample-App button located above the terminal.
You can login with the following username and password:
username: test
password: test
