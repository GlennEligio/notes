Docker Architecture
	> similar to a Client-Server one
	> composed of the following parts
		- Docker Client
		- Docker Daemon
		- Containers
		- Local images
		- Image Registry


Docker Client
	> receives the CLI commands given by the user
	> the Docker Client will send specific request to Docker Daemon based on the command given

Docker Daemon / Docker Engine
	> responsible for 
		- managing Local Containers
		- managing Local Images
		- pulling Images from remote Registries
			-> will only pull remote Images that DOES NOT EXIST in Local images
		- pushing local Images to a remote Registry
	> here, information sent from Docker Client will be used to do actions to the Containers, Local images, or Image Registry
