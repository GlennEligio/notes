24. Centralized Logging and Monitoring in GKE

Navigating through Logging Panel of GKE
1. Go to Clusters tab
2. Click the Cluster where the logs you want to see is located
3. Go to Features section, and find the "View Logs", and "View GKE Dashboard"
4. In Logging Section (from View Logs), go to Logs Explorer
5. In Log fields, choose the following
	- Resource type: Kubernetes Container
	- Pod_name: Name of Pod you want to search
6. To fine grain our search, we can use the Query preview section
	> here, we can add Queries to make the search of Logs precise
	> in our case, we are trying to trace a request


Tracing Request in GCP Logs Explorer
1. To do a tracing, we will need to have Spring Cloud Starter Sleuth dependency in the Spring Boot apps
	> Earlier, we left the Spring Cloud Starter Sleuth dependency
	> this is because this dependency is responsible for adding trace and span ids in the request as it goes through the microservice
	> these trace and span ids adding feature is integrated in the logger itself
2. Using a specific trace id of a request, we can search trace the request itself
	> to do this we will add a query in the Query Builder of GCP Logs Explorer
		- textPayload:<traceId>
		- ex: textPayload:f92d1697ddaa6f53


Monitoring K8s cluster using GKE
1. Go to GKE Dashboard
	> we can do this by clicking the "View GKE Dashboard earlier"
2. In the GKE Dashboard, we can see the following objects like
	- Clusters
	- Namespaces
	- Nodes
	- Workloads
	- Kubernetes services
	- Pods
	- Containers
3. We can also see information on these objects like
	- Alerts
	- Container restarts
	- CPU utilization
	- Memory utilization
	- Disk utilization
