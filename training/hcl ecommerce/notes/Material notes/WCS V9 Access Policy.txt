WCS V9 Access Policy

HCL Access Policies
	> Access control in an HCL Commerce application is composed of the following elements:
		- users
		- actions
		- resources
		- relationships
	
Users	
	> Users are the people that use the system. 
	> For access control purposes, users must be grouped into relevant access groups. 
	> One common attribute that is used to determine membership of an access groups is roles
	> Roles are assigned to users on a per ogranization basis. 
		- For more information about roles, see Roles
	> Some examples of access groups include:
		- Registered customers
		- Guest customers
		- Administrative groups like customer service representatives
		
Actions
	> Actions are the activities that users can perform on the resource.
	> For access control purposes, actions must also be grouped into relevant actions groups
	> For example, a common action used in a store is a View. 
		- A view is invoked to display a store page to customers. 
		- The views used in your store must be declared as actions and assigned to an action group before they can be accessed.

Resources
	> Resources are the entities that are protected
	> For example, if the action is a view, the resource to be protected is the command that invoked the view
		- ex: "com.ibm.commerce.command.ViewCommand"
	> For access control purposes, resources are grouped into resource groups
	
Relationships
	> Relationships are the relationship between the user and the resource
	> Access control policies may require that a relationship between the user and the resouce be satisfied.
	> For example, users may only be allowed to display the orders that they have created
	> In an HCL Commerce application, there are two main levels of access control.
		1. The first level of access control is performed by the WebSphere Application Server
			- In this respect, HCL Commerce uses WebSphere Application Server to protect enterprise beans and servlets
		2. The second level of access control is the fine-grained access control system of HCL Commerce
		

Types of Access Control
	> There are two types of access control, both of which are policy-based:
		1. Command-level access control
		2. Resource-level access control
		
Command level access Control
	> Command-level (also known as "role-based") access control uses a broad type of policy.
	> You can specify that all users of a particular role can execute certain types of commands.
		- ex: You can specify that users with the Account Representative role can execute any command in the AccountRepresentativesCmdResourceGroup resource group
		- ex 2: Another example policy is to specify that all seller administrators can perform any action specified in the SellerAdministratorsViews Group on any resource that is specified by the ViewCommandResourceGroup

Implementing Access Control
	> This topic describes how to implement access control in customized code.
	> In general, enterprise beans and data beans are resources that you may want to protect. 
		- However, not all enterprise beans and data beans should be protected.
		- Within the existing HCL Commerce applications, resources that require protection already implement the protectable interface.
	> Typically, the question of what to protect comes into play when you create new enterprise beans and data beans. Deciding which resources to protect depends upon your application
	
	
Create Access Policy
	> You must have Site Administrator authority to create an access control policy	
	> Procedure:
		1. Open the Organization Administration Console
		2. From the Access Management menu, click Policies. A list of policies displays
		3. Click New.
		4. On the New Policy page:
			- For Name, specify the unique policy name
			- For Display Name, specify the locale specific name for the new policy
			- For Description, type a description of the policy
			- For User Group, click Find. The Find User Group page display
		5. On the Find User Group page:
			- Check the box beside the user group you want to work with and Click OK; or
			- Click the user group hyperlink to select that user group and to return to the previous page
		6. For Resource Group
			- Select the resource group to which the policy applies.
			- Note that only those resource groups that have actions grops associated with them are displayed.
			- In addition, the Action Group and Relationship fields are dependent on the resource group you select
		7. For Action Group, select the action group
		8. For Relationship, select the relationship
			- Note that this field is OPTIONAL
		9. If the Policy type is for the default organization, select Default Organization Policy
			- Note that this option is available only for the Site Administrator.
		10. Click OK	
			- A message box tells you that a policy has been added and prompts you to refresh the Policy Registry to apply recent changes to the run-time environment.
			- Click OK
