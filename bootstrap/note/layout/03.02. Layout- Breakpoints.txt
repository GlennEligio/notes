03.02. Layout- Breakpoints

Breakpoints
	> Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves accross devices

Breakpoints Core concepts
1. Breakpoints are building blocks of responsive design
	> use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size
2. Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint
	> Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters
	> Bootstrap commonly use min-width property in their media queries
3. Mobile first, responsive desgin is the goal


Available breakpoints
	> Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as "grid tiers", for building responsively
	> These breakpoints can be customized if you're using Bootstrap's source Sass files
	> SYNTAX IS: prop-breakpoint-number
		-> ex: col-sm-4, md-lg-4, etc

Breakpoints		Class infix		Dimensions 
X-Small			None			<576px
Small			sm			>=576px
Medium			md			>=768px
Large			lg			>=992px
Extra large		xl			>=1200px
