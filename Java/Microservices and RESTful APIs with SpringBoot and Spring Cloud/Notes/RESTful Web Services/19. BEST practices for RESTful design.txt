19. BEST practices for RESTful design


BEST practices for RESTful design

1. Consumer First
	> always think about the consumer of RESTful webservice (or services in general)
	> Will they be able to understand the naming of your resources?

2. Have proper Service Definition / Documention for the APIs
	> make sure that consumres understand the documentation of your API

3. Make best use of HTTP
	> make best use of REQUEST METHOD
		- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
	> use the right request method appropriate for your specific action
	> Send a proper RESPONSE STATUS back for the action
		- 200 OK
		- 404 NOT FOUND
		- 400 BAD REQUEST
		- 201 CREATED
		- 401 UNAUTHORIZED
		- 500 SERVER ERROR

4. No SECURE/SENSITIVE INFO in URI
	> includes username, password, ssn

5. Always use PLURALS for URI naming
	> prefer /users instead of /user
	> prefer /users/1 instead of /user/1

6. Use NOUNS for RESOURCES
	> examples
1.	/deleteAccount/1
	DELETE /accounts/1
2. 	/getAccounts
	GET /accounts/


7. Define a CONSISTENT APPROACH for exceptions

EX:
for actions not related to CRUD, use /{actionName}

/search
/refresh
PUT /gist/{id}/star
DELETE /gist/{id}/star
