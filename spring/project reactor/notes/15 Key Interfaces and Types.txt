15 Key Interfaces and Types

Reactive Streams
 > introduced in Java 9
 > this includes the Flow API
 
Flow API
 > consist of THREE abstractions
 	1. Publisher
	2. Subscriber
	3. Subscription
 > with Project Reactor, you will most commonly use the Subscription
 > again, these are the interfaces only, which means we will not use any of these directly
	- instead, we will use a library that implement these interfaces
	- with this, we dont need to bother ourselves with the implementations  


Flux and Mono
 > two Types that you will commonly use
 > Flux represents an asynchronous sequence of items
	- it can also support synchronous event by defining how fast the emission of event is
 > Mono represents an asynchronous item that may or may not come in the future
 > main difference between the two is the number of items that it intents to send
	- for Flux, it could be 0 to N items
	- for Mono, it could be 0 to 1 item

Dependency used
1. reactor-core
	> from io.projectreactor
	> currently we are using version 3.4.14
	> we are using the class implmentations in this library
