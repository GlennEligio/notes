04 How we got to cloud computing


1950s
Mainframes
 > a large bulky computers
 > expensive
 > due to the cost, people use "Time sharing"
	- each programmer that will be using the Mainframes will share the usage of it based on time-window
	- they also share the Mainframe based on the processing power percentages


Model
 > each programmer will submit instructions to the Mainframe via Terminal
 > Terminals are connected to Mainframe

		-> Terminal (programmer 1)
Mainframe	-> Terminal (programmer 2)
		-> Terminal (programmer 3)
		-> Terminal (programmer 4)


Characteristics
1. Shared hardware
2. Use when you want
3. Economies of scale
	> since Mainframe is expensive, typically one Mainframe is bought, and is shared through different users



What happened next?
1. Computers became cheap
2. Everyone could own some
3. Organizations could own some computers
4. Data centers is created
	> due to the computers becoming cheap, data centers became a thing



Application evolution
1. Web applications
	> before, the application must be installed in the computers themselves
	> with Web applications, the app service can be accessed in their own computers remotely
