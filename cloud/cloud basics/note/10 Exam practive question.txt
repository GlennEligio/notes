10 Exam practive question

Example AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam

1. Why would a company decide to use AWS over an on-premises data center? (Select all that apply)
a. Highly available infrastracture
b. Elastic resources based on demand
c. No upfront cost
d. Cost-effective

My answer: 
All, since most of the choice are benefit of using Cloud service (like AWS) over On-premises.
For highly available infrastructure, AWS provide specific service for us to create like Servers, Loadbalancers, Databases, etc, compare to on-premise data centers where you will need to build it from scratch.
Elastic resources based on demand is also a feature in AWS. Example of this is the EC2 server, where you can configure its resources used like CPU, RAM, Drive storage size, etc.
No upfront cost for AWS since they will charge you at the end of the quotation date BASED on the services and resources used.
Cost-effective since you can dynamically change the amount of resources you use compare to on-premises data center`
 


Actual answer:
1. Highly available infrastracture:
	> correct since in AWS, everything is provisioned on demand, which includes the infrastructures
2. Elastic resource based on demand
	> correct since in AWS, you can easily scale up and down the resources you use on demand
3. No upfront cost
	> correct since in onprem, you need to procure the hardwares to use
4. Cost-effective
	> debatable, Cloud promises this but its high debated topic
