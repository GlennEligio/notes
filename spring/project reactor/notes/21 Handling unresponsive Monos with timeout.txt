21 Handling unresponsive Monos with timeout


Unresponsive Monos
 > there are cases where the Mono will become unresponsive and hang forever
 > then, if we are blocking this Mono and waiting for an item, we will never get it
 > to fix this, we will need to define a timeout for the blocking to end
 > once this duration is up, it will throw an Exception related to the timeout


Mono.block(Duration timeout)
 > another method signature of block() where it takes a Duration to define the timeout

EX:
String foo = ReactiveSources.unresponsiveMono().block(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
