148 AWS Outposts

AWS Outputs
 > Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
 > Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems
	- One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs)
	- One for their on-premises infrastructure
 > AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
 > AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
 > You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
