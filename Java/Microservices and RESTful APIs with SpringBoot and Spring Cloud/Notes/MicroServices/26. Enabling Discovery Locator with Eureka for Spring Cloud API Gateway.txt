26. Enabling Discovery Locator with Eureka for Spring Cloud API Gateway


Properties to add
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled
	> defines if the Gateway will use Eureka Service Discovery for its Route Locator
	> the API Gateway needs to have Eureka Discovery Client in its classpath/dependency
	> takes a boolean value (true/false)
	> the URI structure of the API gateway to invoke other Service API endpoints in Eureka Naming Server is
		{API gateway host URL}/{Service Name}/{expose API endpoint of Service}

EX:
If
	1. API gateway service is hosted in http://localhost:8765
	2. Service name is CURRENCY-EXCHANGE
	3. Exposed API endpoint to call is "/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR"
Then the resulting Route URL to call in API gateway is
	http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/UDS/to/INR



spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId
	> defines if the service Id to use in API Gateway URL will be lower case or not
		- by default, Services registed in Eureka Naming Server are in UPPERCASES
		- so to invoke the Services, we will need to type the Service name in UPPERCASE
	> takes boolean value (true/false)
		- if set to false, we CAN ONLY invoke Services in lowercase
		- ex: http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR WILL return a result
		- ex: http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR WILL NOT return a result


EX:
# Gateway Properties
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lowerCaseServiceId=true
