66 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Practice Exam - Questions 1-6

Exam
 > Ensure all tasks are implemented with firewalld and SELinux enabled. 
 > Your server should be able to survive a reboot. Good luck!

1. Interrupt the boot process and reset the root password. Change it to "wander" to gain access to the system
2. Repos are avilable from the repo server at http://repo.eigth.example.com/BaseOS and http://repo.eight.example.com/AppStream for you to use during the exam
3. The system time should be set to your (or nearest to you) timezone and ensure the NTP sync is configured
4. Add the following secondary IP addresses statically to your current running interface. Do this in a way that doesn't compromise your existing settings:
	a. IPV4 - 10.0.0.5/24
	b. IPV6 - fd01::100/64
5. Enable packet forwarding on system1. This should persist after reboot.
6. System1 should boot into the multiuser target by default and boot messages should be present (not silenced)



ANSWERS:
Interrupt the boot process and reset the root password. Change it to "wander" to gain access to the system
1. Reboot the system
2. Interrupt the boot by pressing the up and down
3. Select the first kernel in GRUB
4. Press e to edit the boot config
5. Remove the "rhgb quite" and replace with "rd.break enforcing=0"
6. Start the boot process
7. When presented with switch_root Shell, mount the /sysroot
	$ mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
8. Change root directory to /sysroot
	$ chroot /sysroot
9. Check the user and if root, change password
	$ whoami
	$ passwd
10. Exit the Shell and Switch root
	$ exit
	$ exit
11. Login using the new password
12. Restore context and set SELinux to enforcing again
	$ restorecon /etc/shadow
	$ setenforce 1






Repos are avilable from the repo server at http://repo.eigth.example.com/BaseOS and http://repo.eight.example.com/AppStream for you to use during the exam

1. Check if config-manager command is present
	$ dnf config-manager
2. If not present, install dnf-utils package
	$ dnf install dnf-utils
3. Add the said package repo urls with dnf config-manager
	$ dnf config-manager --add-repo http://repo.eight.example.com/BaseOS 
	$ dnf config-manager --add-repo http://repo.eight.example.com/AppStreams
4. Apply the updates in dnf
	$ dnf update





The system time should be set to your (or nearest to you) timezone and ensure the NTP sync is configured

1. Check if chrony is installed (and running if installed)
	$ man chronyd
	$ systemctl status chronyd
2. Install chronyd and start if it is not
	$ dnf install chronyd
3. Check if sources as available for chronyd to fetch latest time
	$ chronyd sources
	$ vi /etc/chrony.conf
3. Set timezone of system to your timezone
	$ timedatectl list-timezones	list the timezones, use grep to filter
	$ timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Singapore
	$ timedatectl				check the time info
4. Make NTP sync active	
	$ timedate set-ntp yes








Add the following secondary IP addresses statically to your current running interface. Do this in a way that doesn't compromise your existing settings:
	a. IPV4 - 10.0.0.5/24
	b. IPV6 - fd01::100/64

1. Check the current active network interface
	$ ifconfig			take note of the connection with 192.168.x.x as ipv4 address or the highest Rx packets
2. Check the connection name of the one using the active NIC
	$ nmcli connection show	will show the connection names
2. Modify the connection by adding ipv4 and ipv6 address and reload the connection
	$ nmcli connection modify "System eth1" +ipv4.address 10.0.0.5/24
	$ nmcli connection modify "System eth1" ipv6.method manual ipv6.addresses \\Pngsfsdg06.r1-core.r1.aig.net\Aigdata\AIG_APAC\AppV\TH\1620_ORION_UAT_TH\TH-ORN_ORN.FRE.5.0.0.0_v1.02_MSIfd01::100/64
		- will make the specified ipv6 the active one, but the previous ipv6 will still be present
	$ nmcli connection reload		reloads the connections to apply changes
	$ nmcli connection show "System eth1"		check the ipv4 and ipv6 addresses
	




Enable packet forwarding on system1. This should persist after reboot.

1. Open /etc/sysctl.conf file and add a setting "net.ipv4.ip_forward" and set to 1
	$ echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
2. Check the current value of the said setting, reboot, and check again
	$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
	$ reboot
	$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward






System1 should boot into the multiuser target by default and boot messages should be present (not silenced)
1. Set multi-user.target as default target when booting up
	$ systemctl set-default multi-user.target
2. Open the /etc/default/grub, go to "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX", and remove the "rhgb quiet" portion of the string value
	$ vi /etc/default/grub		
 	> remove "rhgb quiet" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX value
3. Apply changes by using the "grub2-mkconfig" command to the /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
	$ grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
