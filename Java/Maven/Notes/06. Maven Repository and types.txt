06. Maven Repository and types


Types of Maven Repository
1. Local Repository
	> can be treated as local cache for libraries
	> located on developer's computer
		- MS Windows: 		c:\Users\<users-home-dir>\.m2\repository
		- Mac and Linux:	~/.m2/repository
	> Maven will search this local repository before going to Maven Central Repository


2. Central Repository
	> by default, Maven will search Maven's Central Repository (remote)
		- https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
	> requires an Internet connection
	> once files are downloaded, they are stored in local repository


3. Private Repositories
	> some company may have created a secret code modules for its developers to use
	> NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC
	> everyone can set up their own private Maven Repository
		- we can secure it with credentials (id/password)
