-- 2. Search the member using the member id --
select * from member where member_id=1003; -- registered --
select * from member where member_id=2002; -- unregistered --
-- 4. Use the member id of the registered user to search for the address --
select * from address where member_id=1003;
select * from address where member_id=2002;
-- 3. Use the member id and role id to see the role name of the user --
select * from mbrrole where member_id=1003;
select * from mbrrole where member_id=2002;
select * from role where role_id=-29

-- 5. Use the orders_id of the order of the registered and unregistered user in orders table --
select * from orderitems where orders_id=1052278487;
select * from orderitems where orders_id=2100181482;
