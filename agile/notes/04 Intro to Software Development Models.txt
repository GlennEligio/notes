04 Intro to Software Development Models

Software Development Models
 > putting the pieces of the puzzle together

Why theres many software development models?
 > each team have different needs
 > each model will solve different needs


Classifications of the Software Development models
1. Predictive vs Adaptive
2. Incremental vs Iterative

Predictive
 > the client/customer have a good understanding of the product that you are building
 > here, you get the product in one shot
 > since we have concrete idea about what product to build, theres no incentive to change the source code drastically during the development phase

Adaptive
 > the customer/client have a general idea on what product to build but not a concrete one
 > starts with an idea, then build a prototype / low-fidelity version of the software
 > based on the feedback from the prototype, we will create a new version of the product
 > Adjust based on the feedback of the customer/client


Incremental
 > customer/client have good idea of what product to build
 > instead of building the product in one-shot, we will do it INCREMENTALLY by its components
 > real-life analogy: creating a car, where we might want to create the wheels, then engine, then chasis, and assemble them in increments
 
Interative
 > customer/client have good idea of what product to build
 > instead of building the product incrementally by its components, we will create a whole product
 > then based on the feedback from the product, we might modify the product or create a new one to satisfy the need
 > real-life analogy: travelling from one place to another, we might initially use a bike, but we might change it into a motorcycle, or a car if bike is not enough
