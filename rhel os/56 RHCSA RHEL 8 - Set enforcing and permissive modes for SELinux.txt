56 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Set enforcing and permissive modes for SELinux


SELinux
 > created by National Security Agency (NSA) of USA
 > built-in by default into Linux
 > SELinux defines access controls for the applications, processes, and files on a system. 
	- It uses security policies, which are a set of rules that tell SELinux what can or canâ€™t be accessed, to enforce the access allowed by a policy. 
 > When an application or process, known as a subject, makes a request to access an object, like a file, SELinux checks with an access vector cache (AVC), where permissions are cached for subjects and objects.
 > If SELinux is unable to make a decision about access based on the cached permissions, it sends the request to the security server. 
	- The security server checks for the security context of the app or process and the file. 
	- Security context is applied from the SELinux policy database. 
	- Permission is then granted or denied. 


Relevant files
/var/log/messages
 > contains all the log messages made by the application
 > for the SELinux, when a permission is denied, a message with "avc: denied" will be added in this file


/etc/selinux/config
 > contains the configuration of SELinux
 > two properties are inside
	1. SELINUX - refers to SELinux mode (permissive, enforcing, disabled)
	2. SELINUXTYPE - refers to the processes that will be protected under SELinux (targeted, minimum, mls)



Changing SELinux mode
 > we can do it in two ways, either execute "setenforce" command or change "/etc/selinux/config" values
 > after changing the SELinux mode, reboot the system to apply changes made


Checking AVC denied logs messages
 > to view the messages, open the "/var/log/messages" and search "avc: denied"



Commands
getenforce
 > prints the current mode of SELinux


setenforce
 > modify the mode SELinux is running in
 > sypnosis:
	$ setenforce [Enforcing|Permissive|1|0]
 > ex:
	$ setenforce 1
		- puts SELinux in Enforcing mode
	$ setenforce 0
		- puts SELinux in Permissive mode


sestatus
 > SELinux status tool
 > prints the SELinux status information 

ex:
              SELinux status:              enabled
              SELinuxfs mount:             /selinux
              SELinux root directory:      /etc/selinux
              Loaded policy name:          targeted
              Current mode:                permissive
              Mode from config file:       enforcing
              Policy MLS status:           enabled
              Policy deny_unknown status:  allow
              Memory protection checking:  actual (secure)
              Max kernel policy version:   26
