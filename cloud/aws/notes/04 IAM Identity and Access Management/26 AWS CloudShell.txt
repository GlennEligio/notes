25 AWS CloudShell

AWS CloudShell
 > Using AWS CloudShell, a browser-based shell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), experiment with service APIs using the AWS CLI, and use other tools to increase your productivity. 
 > The CloudShell icon appears in AWS Regions where CloudShell is available as a CLI icon


Using AWS CloudShell
 > here, we can issue "aws" command just like we did in the CMD with AWS CLI installed
 > the credentials used in this AWS CloudShell (that one we configured using "aws configure") is the credential of the Account or IAM User that opened this


AWS CloudShell characteristic
1. the region target of your command is based on where you opened this CloudShell
2. the machine that is running the CloudShell will NOT be reset
	> this means any file you create inside will persist after you turn off CloudShell
3. Through the Action dropdown, you can:
	> Download and Upload file
	> Edit the style of CLI



NOTE:
1. Since not all Region have access to AWS CloudShell, we can specify the region target of an aws command using the flag '--region'
 > ex: aws iam list-users --region ap-southeast-1
 > note that IAM is a Global service, so theres no need for this
