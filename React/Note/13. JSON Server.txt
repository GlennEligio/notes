		"server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"
	> run the script in the root directory of React app
		npm run server
	> the command above will create a file named db.json
		- this json file will have some default content that we can overrite
	> the Route/Paths of this Mock Rest API that we can call changed dynamically
		- will changed based on the content of the json file
