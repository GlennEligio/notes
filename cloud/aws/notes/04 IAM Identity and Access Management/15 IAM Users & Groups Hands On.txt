15 IAM Users & Groups Hands On

IAM Dashboard
Creating User
1. Go to Access management -> Users
2. Click Add Users
3. Set the username
4. Choose Password for AWS Credential type
5. Choose custom password, then write the password
6. Uncheck the require password reset since we will be the only one to create this


Creating Group
1. After creating user, you will be redirected to creating group
2. Pass the group name "admin"
3. Assign a policy named "AdministratorAccess" with type JobFunction


Creating Tag
 > Tags are key value pairs we add to a User
 > this is helpful for keeping track of numbers of user
 > ex: Department tags, Team tag, Level tag, etc
 > UserA with Department tag of value "Engineering"


Finishing User creation
1. After creating the User, you can have an option to download a file csv which contains
	> username
	> password
	> access key
	> secret access key
	> console login link
2. We can also send an email for login instruction to specific email address




Changing AWS Account alias
 > by default, the AWS Account ID (12 digit random string) is the AWS Account alias
 > we can change this by going to IAM Dashboard, and in the right side, we can see the Account Alias and the option to create a new one (besides the default account id value)
 > once change, we can use the Sign in URL for IAM users below the Account Alias, which typically is in format
	"https:://<ACCOUNT_ALIAS>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console"



Logging in as IAM User
1. Use the Sign in URL for IAM users which can be seen in IAM dashboard
2. By default, we will see the Account Alias, and we will only need to provide the IAM User username and password
3. When logged in, we will be seeing at the top right our IAM username and the Account alias



NOTES:
1. IAM in a Global service
2. Use root account is bad practice. Instead create another account that we will make into an Administrator account
	> this Admin account will have all permission root account have
	> unless we need to, we will avoid using root account
3. Policies are attached to a Group. All users under that group will receive the permission passed to a Group via Policy
4. Downloading CSV of new Users is important if the password used is auto-generated
