56 AMI Hands On


GOAL:
1. Demonstrate AMI creation and usage


Creating AMI
1. Create an EC2 instance, the same as earlier, but with different User Data
	> in this case, we will use a User Data that will only install the httpd and not customize its index.html page

User Data script to use
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd


2. Check if the EC2 instance is working
	> copy the Public IP address and paste it in the browser
	> you should see the Test Page of the httpd Apache Web Server
3. Click the EC2 instance in the EC2 Dashboard
4. Click Actions > Image and templates > Create image
5. Provide the name of the AMI image 
	> DemoImage for name
6. Go to EC2 Dashboard > Images > AMIs to see if the AMI is created




Using the AMI
1. Create another EC2 instance
2. This time, in the Application and OS images, choose My AMIs and select the one we created earlier
3. Also, change the User Data script so that it will just modify the default index.html of the Apache Webserver httpd

User Data script to use
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

4. Launch the EC2 instance
5. Using the Public IP address, check the Apache webserver
	> we should now see a modified page, instead of the Test Page earlier
