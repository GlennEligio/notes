05 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Use grep and regular expressions to analyse text


Commands
grep "regexp" FILE
 > command used to find lines in a file that matches the regexp provided
 > ex: grep "[CcFa]a[RrTt]" kafka.txt
	- will match to the lines with words like CaR, FaR, FaT, fat, car, cat

vi FILE
 > opens a VIM editor and display the contents of the FILE
 > if FILE doesnt exist, when VIM editor is saved, it will automatically create the said file
 > ex: vi kafka.txt


Regexp Notes:
1. "^" is added to denote the start of the line to match
	> ex: "^d" will only match to the lines that starts with "d"
2. "$" denotes the end of the line
	> ex: "ed$" will only match to the lines that ends with "ed"
3. "[]" denotes a range of characters, or set of characters that a single character can match
	> ex: "[0-9]" will match to a character from 0 to 9, "[CsDt]" will match to the string with characters C, s, D, t
4. "." will match to ANY character
	> ex: "st..id" will match to the word "stupid"
5. "\" is used for escaping special characters
	> ex: "\." will match to any lines with character "." and not to any lines with characters "\" + any char
6. "*" is used to match all the previous character before the said symbol
	> ex: "hap*[e-z]n[a-i]d" will match to "happened" "happpppppened" "happppppppppened"
7. ".*" can be used to match any characters of any length
	> ex: "hap.*d" will match to "happied" "haphazard", it will match as long as it has "hap" and "d", any characters in between is ok

2. Finding directories and files in a specific directory
	> $ ls -l | grep "^d"
		- for displaying directories/folders only
	> $ ls -l | grep "^-" 
		- for displaying files only
