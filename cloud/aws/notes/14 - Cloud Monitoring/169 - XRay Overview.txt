169 - XRay Overview

AWS X-Ray
 > used for debugging in AWS by giving you a VISUAL ANALYSIS OF OUR APPLICATIONS
	- this includes:
		a. average request process time
		b. request processed per min
		c. name of the resource (ex: myfrontend-dev, 169.254.169.254)
		d. AWS ARN (Amazon Resource Name)
		e. ratio of successful and failed request processing
		f. see services connections and dependencies

Why use AWS X-Ray?
 > typically, debugging in Production in old way, we will do:
	1. Test locally
	2. add log statements everywhere
	3. re-deploy production build, and check the logs
 > the log formats differs across applications and log analysis is hard
 > for MONOLITH APPS, this may be easy since theres only one place the logs are stored, but for MICROSERVICES, each services will have their own log formats and storages
 > in old way, there is also NO COMMON VIEWS of your entire architecture
 
AWS X-Ray advantages
1. Easy for troubleshooting performance (see bottlenecks)
2. Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
3. Pinpoint service issues
4. Review request behavior
5. Find errors and exceptions
6. Easy to see if we are meeting time SLA
7. See which services request are throttled
8. Identifty users that are impacted
