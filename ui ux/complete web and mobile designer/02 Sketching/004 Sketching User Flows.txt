004 Sketching User Flows

Steps:
1. Understand what we will draw
	> determine if we will sketch a large journey or a small interaction
2. Define a starting point
	> we can choose either start, middle, or end of journey
3. Decide your next steps
	> know which step this lead our users, 
	> where do we want them to go, 
	> what does the user need to do to get there


GOAL:
1. Create a General journey

STEPS: Create a General Journey
1. Mapping the overall journey for our user habitual
	> draw a frame
	> ex: 1st frame is a welcome page, with buttons for onboarding
	> 2nd frame might be a search page, where the user can search for items
		- this frame will have a search bar, and below will be the search result item
		- this search result item will be a "card", with image and description below
	> 3rd frame will be the products details page
		- here, the page will display the products details
		- it will contain the enlarged product image, and more detailed information about the product
	> 4th frame will be the cart page
		- here, we will see the products that is in the cart and ready to be checkout
		- it will contain the list of items, with the amount of that item, and also a checkout button
	> 5th frame will be a confirmation page
		- the user will be navigated there if they checkout the product, it will also contain the status of the delivery
		- contains a message to tell user the status of checkout
	> 6th frame will be a delivered page
		- the product is delivered
		- contains message of the delivery status


NOTES:
1. Happy path will NOT ALWAYS be the user experience
2. Alternate scenarios/paths will be the path the user will take
	> typically, these alternate paths DIVERGES from a specific step in the Happy path
	> this can include
		- error messages when an operation is not successful
		- changes in pages like when we use filter to change search result list
		- error page when an information is unavailable to fetch
3. Determine the user experience for each frame on the user journey
	> for welcome page, they might be happy
	> for search page, they might be confused, so we need to make sure to have an easy search experience
