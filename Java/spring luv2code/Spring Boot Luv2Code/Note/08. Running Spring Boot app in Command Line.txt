08. Running Spring Boot app in Command Line


Why use CLI to run the Spring Boot app
	> no need to use IDE to run the application
	> no need to have separate server installed/running
		- Spring Boot app comes with an embedded server
	> Spring Boot apps are self-contained
		- jar file includes application code AND server


TWO APPROACHES
1. java command
	> to do this, we will need a JDK installed in local machine
	> to run a Spring Boot app in CLI we will use
		 ex: java -jar mycoolapp.jar
	> but, to be able to do this, we would need to build the app using mvnw command
	> then after building, we will CHANGE DIRECTORY by going to target folder of project
		- inside the target folder, we will see the final .jar file of the Spring Boot application
	> then, inside the target folder, we will use the java command
		ex: java -jar mycoolapp.jar

PROCESS
1. Build the app
	mvnw package
2. Change directory to target folder
	cd target
3. Run the jar file
	java -jar buildname.jar

		

2. mvn or mvnw command
	> unlike java command, we will not need to have Maven installed to run Spring Boot apps
		- we can use the wrapper files
		- but if we have Maven installed we can just use the normal mvn commands
	> to do this, we must have the Spring Boot Maven plugin in the pom.xml file

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>

	> to run a Spring Boot app in CLI we will use
		mvnw package
		mvnw spring-boot:run
	> or if we have Maven installed in the local machine
		mvn package
		mvn spring-boot:run

PROCESS
1. Build the Maven project
	mvnw package
2. Run the Maven project
	mvnw spring-boot:run


NOTE:
1. The location of the command line must be the project folder of the Spring Boot what are trying to run

	EX: D:\Study\programming\java the hutt\Workspaces\spring-boot-tutorial-luv2code\04-command-line-demo

2. For the JAVA_HOME error, 
	- create an system environment variable of JAVA_HOME
	- set value to the bin folder inside the JDK installation folder
		ex: JAVA_HOME 
		     C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.12\bin

3. To stop the Spring Boot app in Command line, press CTRL+C
