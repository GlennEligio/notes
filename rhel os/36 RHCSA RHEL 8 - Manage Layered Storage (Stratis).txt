36 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Manage Layered Storage (Stratis)

Stratis 
 > Stratis is a local management storage solution added into RHEL8. 
 > Stratis supports the following features:
	1. Thin provisioning (allocating space but not reserving it).	
	2. Pool-based storage (multiple block devices to a single pool).
	3. Filesystem snapshots
 > to use Stratis, we will need both its daemon and cli component
 > in Stratis, we have something called "Stratis Pool"
	- similar to the Volume Group, where we use block devices such as Physical Volume to "pool" their storage spaces
	- we can then create filesystems and assign storage space to it from the Stratis Pool


Installing Stratis
1. Use dnf to install stratis daemon and stratis cli
	$ dnf install stratisd stratis-cli

Starting, Checking status, and Enabling at boot of Stratis
1. To start, check status, or enable at boot, use the systemctl command to the stratis daemon
	$ systemctl status stratisd
	$ systemctl start stratisd
	$ systemctl enable stratisd


Using Stratis
1. Prerequisite: Make sure the block devices to use DOES NOT have filesystems inside
	$ blkid -p /dev/sdb		to check if /dev/sdb have fs inside
	$ wipefs -a /dev/sdb		to wipe all filesystem inside
2. Create a Stratis pool from the block devices
	$ stratis pool create strat1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
		- creates a stratis pool named "strat1" from block devices "/dev/sdb" and "/dev/sdc"
3. Check if pool is successfully created by checking the pool list
	$ stratis pool list
4. Create a filesystem on the newly created pool
	$ stratis fs create strat1 fs1
5. Check if filesystem is successfully created by checking the pool's filesystem list
	$ stratis fs list strat1
6. Check the block devices in system as well
	$ lsblk
7. Mount the newly created filesystem
	$ stratis fs list strat1			-> check the device name of the filesystem to mount
	$ mount /dev/stratis/strat1/fs1 /mnt
8. OPTIONAL: Add the filesystem to fstab to mount permanently
	$ lsblk		get the UUID of the filesystem, the use it to define the filesystem to mount inside /etc/fstab
9. Add another block device to a stratis pool
	$ stratis pool add-data strat1 /dev/sdd
	$ stratis pool list					-> check the change in size
10. Create a stratis filesystem SNAPSHOT
	$ stratis fs snapshot strat1 fs1 snapshot1
11. Confirm the snapshot has been created
	$ stratis fs list strat1
12. Test the snapshot by mounting and unmounting it
	$ mount /dev/stratis/strat1/fs1
	$ ls /mnt
	$ touch /mnt/newfile
	$ ls /mnt
	$ umount /dev/stratis/strat1/fs1
	$ ls /mnt
13. Snapshot the current filesystem state
	$ stratis fs snapshot strat1 fs1 snapshot2
14. Remove a snapshot
	$ stratis fs destroy strat1 snapshot1
	$ stratis fs destroy strat1 snapshot2
15. List all stratis filesystem inside the stratis pool
	$ stratis fs list strat1
16. Remove a stratis pool by removing all the remaining filesystem inside
	$ stratis fs destroy strat1 fs1		-> remaining fs
	$ stratis pool destroy strat1
17. Check the stratis pool list
	$ stratis pool list
	$ lsblk			-> sdb must be clean again



Commands
blkid
 > locate/print block device
 > options:
	-p	switch to low-level superblock probing mode, where we can see the partitions and filesystem in block device
 > ex:
	$ blkid -p /dev/sdb
		- checks the block device "/dev/sdb" and its partitions/filesystem

wipefs
 > wipe a signature from a device
 > used to erase filesystem, raid, or partition-table signature from the specified device
 > sypnosis
	$ wipefs [options] device...
 > options
	-a	erase all available signatures
 > ex:
	$ wipefs -a /dev/sdb


STRATIS COMMANDS
stratis
 > configure stratis local storage pool
 > can use specific commands to target resources like pool, filesystem, blockdev, key, report, or daemon

stratis pool create POOLNAME DEVICE...
 > used to create a Stratis Pool from the list of devices
 > ex:
	$ stratis pool create strat1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
		- creates a Stratis pool "strat1" using block devices "/dev/sdb" and "/dev/sdc"

stratis pool list
 > list all stratis pool available

stratis pool destroy POOLNAME
 > destroy the specified Stratis pool

stratis pool add-data POOL DEVICE...
 > used to add more block devices to the Stratis pool


stratis fs create POOL FILESYSTEM
 > used to create a filesystem from the specific pool
 > ex:
	$ stratis fs create strat1 fs1
		- creates a filesystem "fs1" under the "strat1" stratis pool

stratis fs list POOL
 > list all stratis filesystem from specified pool
 > if no pool is passed, will list all fs of all pools

stratis fs snapshot POOL SOURCE_FS SNAPSHOT_FS
 > used to create a snapshot of the specified filesystem in the same pool
 > ex:
	$ stratis fs snapshot strat1 fs1 snapshot1
		- creates a new snapshot of "fs1" named "snapshot1" inside the "strat1" pool

stratis fs destroy POOL FS
  > used to delete a specific filesystem under a specific stratis pool
