84 S3 Replication Hands On


Creating the Source and Destination Buckets
1. Create two Buckets
	> name them appropriately
		- glenneligio-ccp-2022-source-replication
		- glenneligio-ccp-2022-destination-replication
	> also, enable versioning on both
	> you can also host them in different region to demonstrate CRR (Cross Region Replication)


Enabling Replication
1. Go to the Source Bucket
2. Go to Management Tab > Replication Rules
3. Create a Replication Rule
	> name: DemoReplicationRule
	> status: enabled
	> rule scope: apply to all objects
	> destination: the destination bucket earlier
	> iam role: let S3 create new role
	> leave other options
	> Create replication rule
	> when prompted with replicate existing objects, select No
		- this feature is outside S3, so you might be charged



Demonstrate Replication
1. Upload a file in the Source bucket
2. Wait for the file to be present as well in the Destination
3. Check the version IDs of the Object in both Source and Destination
	> they should be the same
