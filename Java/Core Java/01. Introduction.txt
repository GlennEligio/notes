Why Java
1. Top 3 most popular language
2. Extremely flexible (businesses, web apps, android apps, games)
3. Easy to find a job as a developer



Source code to object code
	> Programs are between spectrum of two extremes
		a. High-level language
		b. Low-level language

1. High-level language (for human)
	> typically it starts with a source code
	> Source code are easily readable by human (alphabets)
	> Source code look something like this
		
		print("Hi mom!")

	> ends with .java file extension

2. Low-level language (for computers)
	> typically it is an object code or machine code
	> Machine code consist of ZEROES and ONE (binary)
	> HARD for humans to read 


Compiler
	> transforms source code into machine code
	> machines can only understand machine code (binary)
	> to transform the source code we have written to object code, we will COMPILE it using Compiler



Byte code
	> every machine have its own specific machine code that it can understand (Window, Mac, Linux, etc)
	> if source code is compiled in Windows, it typically can only run in Windows machine
	> because of this, Java made "byte code"
	> Byte code is cross-platform, meaning it can be run in any platform as long as the machine have the JVM
	> Byte code typically have the .class file extension



Java Virtual Machine
	> enables the byte code to be run in the machine
	> translate the byte code into machine code in runtime



JDK, JRE, JVM

Java Development Kit
	> developer's toolkit to help us code
	> contains JRE

Java Runtime Environment
	> contains libraries and toolkit
	> contains JVM

Java Virtual Machine
	> translate byte code into machine code
	> runs java programs


Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
	> software that helps us write software 
	> used for
		- write code
		- check for errors
		- compile
		- run code


IDEs for Java
	> Eclipse
	> IntelliJ IDEA 



Class
	> a collection of related code
