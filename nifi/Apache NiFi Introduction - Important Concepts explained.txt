Apache NiFi Introduction - Important Concepts explained

FlowFile
 > basically the data
 > comprised of two elements
	1. Content - the data itself
	2. Attributes 	- key:value pairs associated with the data (creation date, )
					- basically the metadata of the flowfile
 > this gets PERSISTED to disk after creation
	- wont be stored in memory, instead it get straight to the disk
	
	
Processor
 > applies a set of transformations and rules to FlowFiles, to generate NEW FlowFiles
 > any processor can process any FlowFile
 > Processors are passing FlowFile references to each other to advance the data processing
 > They are all running in parallel (different threads)
 
Process graph

						flowfile 1					FlowFile 2
Data ----> Processor 1 ------------> Processor 2 ------------> Processor N




Connector
 > its basically a queue of all the FlowFiles that are YET to be processed by Processor (in graph below, by Processor 2)
 > it defines rules about how FlowFiles are prioritized (which ones first, which ones not at all)
 > can define backpressor to avoid overflow in the system
	- EX: if backpressure defined is 10000, after 10000 FlowFile it will stop creating new FlowFiles
