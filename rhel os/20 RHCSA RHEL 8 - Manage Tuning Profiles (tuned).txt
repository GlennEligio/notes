20 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Manage Tuning Profiles (tuned)

tuned
 > a dynamic adaptive system tuning daemon
 > tunes the system settings dynamically depending on usage
 	- ex: if it sees that the machine is running as virtual machine it will tune the system for that
 > built into most RHEL OS machines, but if not, we can use the command below to install
	$ dnf install tuned
 > to start and enable the "tuned" daemon, we can use the systemctl command
	$ systemctl start tuned
	$ systemctl enable tuned
	$ systemctl status tuned
