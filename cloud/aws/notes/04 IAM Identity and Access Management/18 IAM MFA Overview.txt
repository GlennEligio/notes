18 IAM MFA Overview

IAM - Password Policy
 > Strong password means higher security for your account
 > in AWS, you can setup a password policy, which includes:
	1. Set a minimum password length
	2. Require specific character types like including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or non-alphanumeric characters
 	3. Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	4. Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
	5. Prevent password re-use



Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
 > Users have access to your account and can possibly change configuration or delete resources in your AWS account
 > You want to protect BOTH your Root Accounts and IAM users. This is where MFA comes in
 > MFA refers to authentication that uses one or more factors like
	- things that you KNOW (password)
	- things that you OWN (security keys, authenticator devices)
	- things that are INHERIT TO YOU (fingerprint)
