14 Blocking Flux to get a Stream of element

Flux.toStream()
 > converts a Flux into Stream
 > this will BLOCK the current thread Flux is running, until ALL element arrived in which it will be transformed into a Stream

EX:
public class Exercise3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        // Use ReactiveSources.intNumbersFlux()

        // Get all numbers in the ReactiveSources.intNumbersFlux stream
        // into a List and print the list and its size
        List<Integer> intList = ReactiveSources.intNumbersFlux().toStream().toList();
        System.out.println("List is: " + intList);
        System.out.println("Total items: " + intList.size());


        System.out.println("Press a key to end");
        System.in.read();
    }

}
