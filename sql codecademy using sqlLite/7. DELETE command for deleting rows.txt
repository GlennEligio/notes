DELETE DATA ENTRIES IN THE TABLE
	> in order to delete, we will need two things
		a. call DELETE FROM command and pass the table Name
		b. a conditional WHERE if a row has met it, it will delete that row

EXAMPLE:

 DELETE FROM celebs
 WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;

Here, we will first call the DELETE FROM command in order to get permission to delete rows in the "celebs" table. Then we will create a conditional (if twitter handle IS NULL) that if the row met the condition, then it will be DELETED.
