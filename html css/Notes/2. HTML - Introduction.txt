HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
	> responsible for webpage structure

<element>content</element>
	> this will be the structure of the lines in HTML 

EX:
	<h1>Heading</h1> for Heading Element
	<p>Paragraph</p> for Paragraph Element
	<img src="..."> for Image Element
	<bt/> for Line Break

Includes:

Live Server
	> extension for having a live server to see the changes we make in code in real time
	> this creates a local development server to run our program.
	> it then checks for changes and updates the program running in local server


Basic HTML Page Structure
	1. HTML Version
		> tells what version of HTML it uses
	2. Root Element
		> wraps all the contents of the html page
		> contains ATLEAST ONE <head> and <body> tag
	3. Head
		> contains information about the page (meta, links, title)
		> wraps the <title> tag which is the Page title
	4. Body
		> contains the page content or contents that will be shown in the browser


Preference in using Auto Save in Webpage making
	> only use Auto Save alongside Live Server when customizing the Webpage content
	> if we are working in Back-end function like writing Javascript, it is PREFERRED to not use Auto Save


Emmet
	> Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow:
	> with Emmet, we can omit typing the angle bracket whenever we create an HTML element


White space collapsing
	> characteristic where whitespaces are ignored
	> in HTML, whitespaces in code and the value of the elements itself
	> ex: <h1>Hello     world</h1> 	-> Hello world


I. Create first HTML

1. Create new folder to contain our project
	> name: html


2. Create new html file inside html project folder
	> index.html


3. Inside the index.html, add the following
	> Header element with "hello world" as content
	> Paragraph element with "this is my first webpage" as content


4. Save the index.html file, and open it using a browser
	> we can see the header and paragraph that we added in index.html file




II. Live Server demonstration

5. Install Live Server extension in Visual Studio code
	> also, enable it


6. Go back to the Visual Studio Code
	> open the index.html file
	> at the bottom of VS Code, press Go Live option
	> or right-click in index.html, then choose Open with Live Server

	As we can see, we get an error message from the Live Server extension. It says that

		"Live Reload is not possible without body or head tag."

	So in next step, we will learn how to make a proper html structure.



III. Making a proper HTML structure 

7. Remove our previous line of codes


8. Add a DOCTYPE tag

	<!DOCTYPE html>


9. Add an html element

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    
</html>



10. Add head element inside the html element
	> also, add title tags inside head tags and give it a value

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>first webpage</title>
    </head>
</html>



11. Add a body tags inside the html tags (same level as head tags)
	> inside body element, add the following
		a. header element
		b. paragraph element

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>first webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, i am glenn</h1>
        <p>and this is my first webpage</p>
    </body>
</html>



12. Restart the Live Server
	> close the Live Server
	> open it again
	> we should see our new webpage, with following changes
		- name of webpage in browser tab is not the serverip/html file anymore, instead its the <title>


13. Demonstrate the Live Server function
	> change the paragraph element value of the index.html file
	> save the file
	> see the changes happen in the Live Server 



14. Enable autosave in VS Code
	> to enable it, go to file, the click Auto Save option
	> this way, we dont need to repeatedly save the index.html file in order for us to see the changes in Live Server


15. Add another header element inside the body
	> this time, as you type the value of the header, we can see the changes in the Live Server

 


IV. Emmet Demonstration
	
16. Add a new paragraph element inside the body
	> but instead of typing angle bracket, directly type the "p"
	> in the IntelliSense options, we can see the Emmet Abbreviation option
	> when we choose this, it will automatically create the HTML element corresponding to what we choose and we will only need to define its value

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>first webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, i am glenn</h1>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>and this is my first webpage and its very gooodd!!!</p>
        <p>emmet paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>


17. Use the Emmet to create a simple HTML structure
	> remove all the lines of code we have
	> type the ! symbol and choose it as an option
	> we can see that it automatically creates an HTML structure for us

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>proper structure</h1>
    
</body>
</html>
