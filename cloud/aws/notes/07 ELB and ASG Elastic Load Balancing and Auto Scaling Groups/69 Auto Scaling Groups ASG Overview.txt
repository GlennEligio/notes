69 Auto Scaling Groups ASG Overview

What's an Auto Scaling Group?
 > In real-life, the load on your websites and application can change 
	- EX: In e-commerce, more traffic during day than night
 > In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
 > The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
	- Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
	- Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
	- Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machine running
	- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
	- Replace unhealthy instance
 > Cost Saving: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)

EX:
Here, we can see three properties that we can define in an Auto Scaling Group, the Minimum, Actual/Desired, and the Maximum Size

|--------------------- Maximum Size ----------------------|
|--- Actual Size / Desired Capacity ----|
|-- Min. size --|
<-- EC2 --- EC2 --- EC2 --- EC2 --- EC2 --- EC2 --- EC2 -->
