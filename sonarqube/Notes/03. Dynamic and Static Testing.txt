03. Dynamic and Static Testing

Dynamic Testing
	> Testing where the Tester observes/inspects the behavior of the Code WHILE RUNNING

Static Testing
	> It is a method of debugging by examining source code before program is run
		- i.e. test the code without actually executing it
	> It does so by analyzing the code agains a pre-set of coding rules and ensure that it conforms to the guidelines
	> The cycle includes:
		1. Developer writes code
		2. Static testing tool examines the code and informs Dev about error in code
		3. Developer fixes the error
