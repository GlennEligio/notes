39 Security Groups Hands On


Security Groups
 > earlier, we created an EC2 instance, in which we created a Security Group that it will belong it
 > this Security Group can be accessed either in:
	- EC2 Dashboard > Network & Security > Security Groups
	- EC2 Dashboard > Instances > Instance's Security tab


Security Groups property
 > each Security group have the following properties
	



Testing the Security Group
1. Select the EC2 instance in EC2 Dashboard
2. Go to Security tab
3. Click the Security group we created for it at the start
4. Edit the Inbound rules
5. Remove the Inbound rule for HTTP connection
6. Save the rule
7. Open the EC2 instance, and try to access the httpd service page
	> use the public IP address of EC2 and use HTTP
	> this should load forever, and will throw a CONNECTION TIMEOUT
8. Edit the Security group by adding HTTP into the Inbound rule





NOTE:
1. Theres a default Security Group in EC2 dashboard where it allow ALL inbound and outbound ip address and port
	> should not be used
2. If the application that you are accessing in the EC2 instance loads forever and throws ERR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT, most likely the issue is with the Security Group
3. Type and Source dropdown in Inbound/Outbound rules is just a shortcut for manually entering the Port, Port range and IP address.
	> ex: selecting HTTP will add Port 80
