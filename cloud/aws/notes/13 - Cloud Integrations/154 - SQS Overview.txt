154 - SQS Overview

Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service

What is Queue?
 > composed of the following components
	1. Producers
	2. Queue
	3. Consumers
 > the process involves
	1. the Producer send messages to the Queue
		- there could be one or more Producers
	2. these messages are then stored in the Queue
	3. the Consumers can read the messages from the Queue by polling from the Queue
		- polling means requesting messages from the queue
		- there could be one or more Consumers, which may be different messages
	4. onces the Consumers are done processing a video, then they will delete the message from the queue and it will be gone
 > in this model, we have Producers sending messages in the Queue, and the Consumers polling and processing the messages at different speed
 
 
Amazon SQS - Standard Queue
 > Oldest AWS offering (over 10 years old)
 > Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications
 > Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second
 > Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
 > No limit to how many messages can be in the queue
 > Messages are DELETED after they're read by consumers
 > Low latency (<10 ms on publish and subscribe/receive)
 > Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally 
 
 
Use case:
1. SQS to decouple between application tiers
	> in example below, we have two application tiers, Web Servers and Video Processing, DECOUPLED by the SQS Queue
		- Web Servers are hosted in EC2 instances and uses Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for scaling
		- Video processing also uses EC2 instances and ASG for scaling
	> the process involves
		- request goes to Web Servers
		- web server instance then acts as the Producer and send messages to the SQS Queue
		- the Video processing instances then poll message from the Queue to process them and reply them back
		- SQS queue receives the reply, sends it back to Web servers and delete the message
	> in this case, the Video Processing and Web servers can scale INDEPENDENTLY without affecting one another


EX:						

									PUT
request -----> Web Servers	-------------->	SQS Queue -----------> Video Processing
			- EC2 Instances											- EC2 Instances
			- scaling is handled by ASG								- uses ASG for scaling
