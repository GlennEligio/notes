79 S3 Website Hands On


Prerequisites
1. An HTML file. We will upload this on S3 for website hosting later


Uploading HTML file
1. Go to the root of the S3 Bucket
2. Upload the HTML file
	> you can also upload it in other folders beside root folder
	> but you will need to specify these folder path later


Setting S3 Website hosting
1. Go to the S3 Bucket
2. Go to the Properties tab
3. Scroll until you see the "Static website hosting"
4. Press Edit
5. Select 'Enable'
6. Hosting type - 'Host a static website'
7. For index document, select the HTML file
	> if its in the root directory, just pass the HTML file
		- ex: index.html
	> if its in a folder, specify the folder path
		- ex: html/index.html
8. Pass something in the Error document
	> if does not have to exist, just pass error.html 
	> but if you can upload an HTML file for it, you can do it
9. Leave the redirection rules to empty
10. Save changes
11. Check the 'Static website hosting' section of S3 Bucket Properties again
	> you should see the 'Bucket website endpoint' created by AWS
	> navigate to it, you should see the HTML file rendered



NOTES:
1. All files used inside the HTML hosted in S3 Static Website hosting will be pulled from the S3 bucket as well
	> this means that all the files used inside the index.html SHOULD BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AS WELL
	> in example below, inside the index.html, we used "img/coffee.jpg" file
	> the browser will look for <current-url> + /img/coffee.jpg
	> in this case, there must be an img folder with coffee/jpg file inside and it should be public


EX:
S3 Bucket directory
root
 - index.html
 > img
  	- coffee.jpg
	- cat.jpeg


Index.html

<html>
    <head>
        <title>My First Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>I love coffee</h1>
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>

    <img src="img/coffee.jpg" width=500/>
</html>
