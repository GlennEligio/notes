09. Spring Boot Application Properties file


Application Properties file
	> File that contains all the application properties data
	> by default, Spring Boot reads information from a standard properties file
		- located at: src/main/resources/application.properties
	> you can define ANY custome properties in this file
	> your Spring Boot app can access properties using @Value

@Value
	> annotation used to fetch data from application.properties
	> have one property
		a. value = ""
			- takes a String parameter
			- here we will pass the data name inside the application.properties file with following syntax
			- "${data.name}"
			- ex: @Value(value = "${coach.name}")

EX:
INSIDE application.properties
# Define custome properties
coach.name=Mickey Mouse
team.name=The Mouse Club
	

INSIDE @RestController class

	// inject properties for: coach.name and team.name
	@Value(value = "${coach.name}")	
	private String coachName;
	
	@Value(value = "${team.name}")
	private String teamName;
	
	
	// expose endpoint for team info
	@GetMapping("/teaminfo")
	public String getTeamInfo() {
		return "Coach: " + coachName + ", Team name: " + teamName;
	}
