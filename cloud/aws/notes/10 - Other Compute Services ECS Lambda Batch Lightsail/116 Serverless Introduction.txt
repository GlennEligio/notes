116 Serverless Introduction

Serverless
 > Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore...
 > They just deploy code, or even just functions
 > Initially, the Serverless started as FaaS (Function as a Service)
 > Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed. This includes:
	- databases
	- messaging
	- storage
	- etc
 > Serverless does not mean there are no server.
	- It means you don't have to manage/provision/see them


Example of Amazon Services that is Serverless
1. Amazon S3 - Storage of Objects/Files
2. DynamoDB - Serverless implementation of MongoDB
3. Fargate - for Containers
4. Lambda - FaaS, you deploy a code and AWS will handle the server to host that function/code
