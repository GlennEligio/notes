137 AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

AWS System Manager (SSM)
 > Helps you manage your EC2 and On-Premises systems at scale
 > Another Hybrid AWS service
 > Get operational insights about the syste of your infrastructure
 > Suite of 10+ products
 > Most important features are:	
	- Patching automation for enhanged compliance
	- Run commands across an entire fleet of servers
	- Store parameter configuration with the SSM Parameter Store
 > Works for both Windows and Linux OS



How Systems Manager works
 > We need to install the SSM agent onto the systems we control
 > Installed by default on Amazon Linux AMI & some Ubuntu AMI
 > If an instance can't be controlled with SSM, it's probably an issue with the SSM agent!
 > Thanks to the SSM agent, we can run commands, patch & configure our servers
