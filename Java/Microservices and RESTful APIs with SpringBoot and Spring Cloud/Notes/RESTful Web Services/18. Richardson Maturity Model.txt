18. Richardson Maturity Model


Richardson Maturity Model
	> test if how RESTful the API is

Level 0
Expose SOAP Web Services in REST style
	> typically, URI exposed represent the actions that consumer of web service can do
EX:
http://server/getPosts
http://server/deletePosts
http://server/doThis


Level 1
Expose Resources with a proper URI
	> note: here, there is still an IMPROPER use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH)
EX:
http://server/accounts
http://server/accounts/10
http://server/deleteaccount/1


Level 2
Level 1 + HTTP methods
	> here, we have proper use of HTTP method
	> with this, we can lessen URI polution
EX:
POST 	http://server/accounts
GET	http://server/accounts
GET	http://server/accounts/1
DELETE	http://server/accounts/1


Level 3
Level 2 + HATEOAS
	> contains not only Data, but also the next possible Actions
		- ex: from fetching a single item, we will also receive link for fetch all items
	> same URI usages as the Level 2
