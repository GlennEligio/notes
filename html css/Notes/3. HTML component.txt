HTML Components

includes:
	> Heading
	> Paragraph
	> img
	> Comments
	> Linebreak
	> Linktag

Heading
	> represent a "title" inside the webpage document
	> there are 6 types of heading
		- h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
	> the higher the number, the larger the size. h1 being the largest and h6 the smallest

Paragraph component/element
	> represented by <p>
	> represent a body of text
	> typically where we put the content text 

Whitespace collapsing
	> feature of HTML where whitespaces in code and element value is ignored or collapse

lorem
	> a default dummy text available in the HTML	
	> to use it, type "lorem" and it will show in IntelliSense
	> we can specify how many we want in the lorem by adding number after it
		ex: lorem10 will print out 10 words from it

img
	> element used to show an image
	> have two attributes
		src 	- defines the source location of the image file to be rendered
			- can be from local project folder by providing image file path or from web using image url
		alt 	- defines the text that will be shown if the image file is not rendered properly
	> img element have two appearance
		1. the Image being rendered properly
		2. the Image not rendered and is replaced by an broken image icon with the alt text beside 
	> attributes of img element includes
		1. width and height
			= defines the width or height of an image
			= takes int value which represents the pixel size
			= if only one is defined, the other is adjusted in order to retain the width:height ratio
				EX: if only width is 
	> NOTES:
		1. Even if we lower the pixel size of img in html page, it will still render the full image size
			= to remedy this, we can just crop it to a certain size in a 3rd party application


Pexels or Gratisography
	> sources for free image to use copyright-free


Comments
	> pieces of code that the compiler and runtime ignores
	> in order to comment in the HTML, type the following characters
		<!--
	> as soon as you type these, it will automatically create a comment line
	> you can also use the shortcut CTRL + / in order to make a certain line to be commented


Linebreak
	> represents a "enter" or an empty space between lines
	> to create a linebreak either
		1. type br and use Emmet abbreviation
		2. <br>


Linktag
	> represented by the <a> tag
	> used to show an interactable link to the web page
	> this Linktag element have the following attributes
		1. href - attribute that represent the link that where the user will be navigated when click
			- we can navigate to either external link (webpages that is not included in project folder)
			- or internal link (webpages that is included in project folder)
			- for external link, pass the url. 
					EX: href="https://google.com"
			- for internal link, there are two cases
				a. same html webpage but different webpage location (must have id attribute to the element)
					EX: <h2 id="exampleId">ExampleText</h2>
						href="#exampleId"
				b. different html webpage in same project folder
					EX: href="anotherHtmlFileInTheProjectFolder.html"
			- passing "" will refresh the page
			- passing "#" go to itself
		2. target - defines that target browser tab where the link will be opened
			  - if attribute is not called, link will be opened on tab where we clicked it
			  - if attribute is set to "_blank", browser will open a new tab where the link will be opened
	> ex: <a href="https://google.com">Go to google</a> 
		<a href="about.html">About</a>
	> we can also EMBED a Linktag in an image
		- to do this, NEST an img element inside a linktag



I. Heading component

1. Create 6 headings inside the body
	> have them be of different headers with descending sizes

INSIDE index.html file

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I'm heading 1</h1>
    <h2>I'm heading 2</h2>
    <h3>I'm heading 3</h3>
    <h4>I'm heading 4</h4>
    <h5>I'm heading 5</h5>
    <h6>I'm heading 6</h6>    
</body>
</html>


	> as we can see, the text size of headings get smaller and smaller as we increase the heading number




II. Paragraph

2. Add a paragraph tag in the body section

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>



III. Demonstrating Whitespace collapsing feature of HTML
	
3. Create a heading element	
	> assign it a value of "Hello                world"
	> check the output in Live Server

INSIDE index.html

<body>
    <h1>Hello            world</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>

	> as we can see, the additional spaces are ignored or collapsed by the html


IV. lorem dummy text

4. Give the paragraph element we made earlier a value of lorem

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Molestiae eveniet labore illum ex iure distinctio dolore suscipit tenetur architecto delectus! In necessitatibus ullam minus distinctio magnam dicta, blanditiis error perferendis!</p>
</body>
</html>



V. img element

5. Add an image file inside the project folder
	> we will use this image file in the webpage


6. Add an img element inside the <body>
	> when we add an img element, it will also add two attributes to the img element
		a. src - defines the location of the image in our project folder 
			- we will give a path of the image
		b. alt 	- defines the text that will be shown if the image from src attribute cant be shown

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/Box.jpeg" alt="Image of a box">
</body>
</html>

	> right now, we are seeing the image that we define in the src attribute
	> now, lets enter a wrong image. Lets change the file type of the image in src attr.

<body>
    <img src="/Box.jpeg" alt="Image of a box">
</body>

	> now, we are seeing the default appearance of img element if the image src cant be rendered property




7. Add another img element inside the body
	> this time, we will fetch the image file in the web using the image url link

<body>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/Box.jpg" alt="Image of a box">
    <h3>Image from the web</h3>
    <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vets4pets.com%2Fsiteassets%2Fspecies%2Fcat%2Fcat-close-up-of-side-profile.jpg%3Fw%3D585%26scale%3Ddown&f=1&nofb" alt="Image of a cat">
</body>

	> same as before, if we modify the image url link where it cant fetch the image anymore, it will show the alt text



8. Download the image you got from the web
	> add it in the project folder



9. Change src attribute of the img element
	> instead of the web image url link, we will change it to the location of the image we have downloaded



10. Set the width to be the same as the previous image

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>
<body>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/Box.jpg" alt="Image of a box">

    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/cat-close-up-of-side-profile.webp" 
            alt="Image of a box"
            width="768">
</html>

	> as we can see, the 2nd image has been adjusted to have the same width as the 1st image




VII. Project folder management


11. Create a folder for images
	> name it images


12. Move the images we have in the root project folder to the images
	> now if we look at live server, the images is showing the alt appearance
	

13. Change the src value of the img elements in index.html
	> from "./file.jpg" to "./images/file.jpg"

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/images/Box.jpg" alt="Image of a box">

    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/images/cat-picture.jpg" 
            alt="Image of a box">
</html>

	> now if we take a look at the live server, the images are up once again



VIII. Linebreak

14. Add linebreak between two images
	> add <br> elements between declaration of img elements in body

INSIDE index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/images/Box.jpg" alt="Image of a box">
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/images/cat-picture.jpg" 
            alt="Image of a box">
</html>

	> now, the gap between two images have become wider



IX. Linktag (external, internal)

15. Create a Link tag
	> to create one, type a and choose the a Emmet abbreviation

INSIDE the body of index.html after the img element

    <a href=""></a>


16. Assign it with any external link and assign text value to the Link tag

INSIDE the body of index.html after the img element

	<a href="https://google.com">Go to google</a>


17. Add a target attribute to it
	> this will define where we will open the external link
	> since we typically want to open external links in an empty browser tab, assign _blank to it

INSIDE the body of index.html after the img element

    <a href="https://google.com"
        target="_blank">Go to google</a>

	> now whenever we click, we will open a new tab




18. Create a new html page
	> this will be an About page
	> this time, we will navigate from html pages inside our project
	> change title element inside head to About
	> same with index, change it to Index

INSIDE about.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>About</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>



19. Inside about.html, add the following
	> a paragraph for text placeholder
	> a linktag to navigate us back to index.html

INSIDE body of about.html

    <a href="index.html">Back to index page</a>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Esse, consequuntur itaque. Sapiente, laboriosam. Deleniti, quia.</p>




20. In the index.html, add the following
	> a linktag to navigate us to about.html

INSIDE body of index.html

    <a href="about.html">About</a>




21. Test the webpage
	> we should be about to navigate from the index.html to about.html and back



22. Add a heading at the top of the index.html
	> in the text, indicate that it is the top of the page

INSIDE body of the index.html

    <h2>This is the top of page</h2>
    <a href="about.html">About</a>
    <h3>Image from local resource</h3>
    <img src="/images/Box.jpg" alt="Image of a box">
    <a href="https://google.com"
        target="_blank">Go to google</a>



23. Add a linktag at the bottom of the index.html
	> the purpose of this linktag is to navigate us back to the top of the index.html webpage
	> for us to do this, we will give the href the location in webpage where we want to navigate the user
	> in this case, it is the top of the webpage

INSIDE the body of index.html, at the last line

	<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

	> this will navigate user back to the top of the webpage he is currently in




24. Add many linebreaks at the top of the Back to top linktag
	> make it so that we will not see the image when we are at the bottom




25. Add an id attribute to the heading we added earlier
	> have it the same name as the one we assign in the href of "Back to top" linktag

INSIDE index.html body

	<h2 id="top">This is the top of page</h2>


26. Test the linktag functionality in Live Server
	> we should be navigated back to the location in Webpage where the heading with "top" id is located



27. Create a new Linktag at the top of the index.html with an external url
	
INSIDE body of index.html

    <a href="https://google.com"></a>



28. Nest an img element inside the created Linktag

INSIDE body of index.html at the top

    <a href="https://google.com">
        <img src="./images/cat-picture.jpg" 
            width="200"    
            alt="cat image with google url">
    </a>



29. Test the image with embedded url in Live Server
	> if we hover cursor in image, the cursor should change icon
	> if we click it, we should be navigated to the url specified in the Linktag



30. Change the value of href in Linktag we created
	> from an external url to "#"


31. Test the clickable image again
	> this time, it should not navigate us to anywhere
