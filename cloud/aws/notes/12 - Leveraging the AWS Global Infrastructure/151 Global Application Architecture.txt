151 Global Application Architecture


Global Application Architecture
1. Single Region, Single AZ
	- NOT High Availablity
	- HIGH Global Latency
	+ LOW Difficulty
2. Single Region, Multi AZ
	+ High Availability
	- HIGH Global Latency
	- MEDIUM Difficulty
3. Multi Region, Active-Passive
	> Active passive is where only one application instance have write operation
	+ Global Reads' latency is low
	+ Global Writes' latency is high
	+ MEDIUM Difficulty
3. Multi Region, Active-Passive
	> Active passive is where only all application instance have read/write operations
	+ Global Reads' latency is low
	+ Global Writes' latency is low
	- HIGH Difficulty
