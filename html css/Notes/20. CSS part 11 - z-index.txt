20. CSS part 11 - z-index 


includes
z-index


z-index
	> CSS property that specifies the stack order of an element
	> an element with greater stack order is always in FRONT of an element with lower stack order
	> we can pass values like
		1. auto
			- default value
			- set the stack order equal to its parents
			- if not defined, the default value is 0
		2. integer numbers
			- set the stack order of the element
			- negative numbers are ALLOWED
	

NOTE:
1. z-index only works on POSITIONED ELEMENTS (position: absolute|relative|fixed|sticky, WONT WORK WITH static) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements)
2. If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned LAST in the HTML code will be shown on top.
