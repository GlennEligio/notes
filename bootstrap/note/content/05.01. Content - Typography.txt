Headings
	> Headings in Bootstrap are RESPONSIVE
		-> font size changes based on the screen size (width)
	> Bootstrap also offers utility classes to make an element to look like Heading


Heading class
	> provides properties similar to a heading element (ex: <h1>)
	> these properties include:
	  	margin-top: 0;
  		margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  		font-weight: 500;
  		line-height: 1.2;
	
NOTATION:
h{size}

Size
1-6	1 being the BIGGEST, and 6 being the SMALLEST

EX:
<p class="h1">h1. Bootstrap heading</p>
<p class="h2">h2. Bootstrap heading</p>
<p class="h3">h3. Bootstrap heading</p>
<p class="h4">h4. Bootstrap heading</p>
<p class="h5">h5. Bootstrap heading</p>
<p class="h6">h6. Bootstrap heading</p>



Dispay heading class
	> Traditional heading elements are designed to work best in the meat of your page content. 
	> When you need a heading to STAND OUT, consider using a display heading — a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style.	

NOTATION
display-{size}

Sizes
$display-font-sizes: (
  1: 5rem,
  2: 4.5rem,
  3: 4rem,
  4: 3.5rem,
  5: 3rem,
  6: 2.5rem
);

EX:
<h1 class="display-1">Display 1</h1>
<h1 class="display-2">Display 2</h1>
<h1 class="display-3">Display 3</h1>
<h1 class="display-4">Display 4</h1>
<h1 class="display-5">Display 5</h1>
<h1 class="display-6">Display 6</h1>





Lead
	> used to make a paragraph stand out
	> we do this by adding "lead" class in a paragraph element

ex:
<p class="lead">
  This is a lead paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs.
</p>




Inline text element
	> in Bootstrap, they offer several classes for inline text element styling
	> these classes (or element tags) should be used for SEMANTIC PURPOSE

HTML tags
<mark> 		represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
<small> 	represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text.
<s> 		represents element that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate.
<u> 		represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
<b>		meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance
<i>		mostly for voice, techinical terms, etc

Bootstrap Classes equivalent
"mark"				<mark>
"small"				<small>
"text-decoration-underline"	<u>
"text-decoration-line-through"	<s>


EX:
<p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
<p><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
<p><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
<p><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
<p><u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u></p>
<p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
<p><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
<p><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>





Abbreviations
	> Stylized implementation of HTML’s <abbr> element for abbreviations and acronyms to show the expanded version on hover. 	> Abbreviations have a default underline and gain a help cursor to provide additional context on hover and to users of assistive technologies.
	> Add "initialism" class to an abbreviation for a slightly smaller font-size.

EX:
<p><abbr title="attribute">attr</abbr></p>
<p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" class="initialism">HTML</abbr></p>




Blockquotes
	> for quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.
	> Wrap <blockquote> around any HTML as the quote AND add "blockquote" class

EX:
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
</blockquote>


Naming a source of quote of blockquote
	> The HTML spec requires that blockquote attribution be placed outside the <blockquote>. 
		-> Attribution means citing the source of a thing (i.e. quote)
	> When providing attribution, 
		1. wrap your <blockquote> in a <figure> and 
		2. use a <figcaption> or a block level element (e.g., <p>) with the .blockquote-footer class. 
	> Be sure to wrap the name of the source work in <cite> as well.

EX:
<figure>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
    Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>



Alignment of Blockquote
	> we can align the text of blockquote using the text utilities
		-> we will add these text utilities in the <figure> element that encapsulates the blockquote and figcaption
	> these text utilities for alignment includes
		

EX: text center
<figure class="text-center">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
    Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

EX: text end
<figure class="text-center">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
    Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
  </figcaption>
</figure>




List
Unstyling a List
	> we can remove the styles (symbol and indentation) of list in Bootstrap
	> with this, we will need to use "list-unstyled" class

"list-unstyled"
	> remove the style of a list
		-> similar to "list-style: none"
	> only applies to IMMEDIATE CHILDREN
		-> will not apply to the list item of a nested list

EX:
<ul class="list-unstyled">
  <li>This is a list.</li>
  <li>It appears completely unstyled.</li>
  <li>Structurally, it's still a list.</li>
  <li>However, this style only applies to immediate child elements.</li>
  <li>Nested lists:
    <ul>
      <li>are unaffected by this style</li>
      <li>will still show a bullet</li>
      <li>and have appropriate left margin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This may still come in handy in some situations.</li>
</ul>




Inline list
	> we can also make an inline list
		-> difference is that in default list, list-items are block level. 
		-> here, the list items are inline level
	> to do this, we will need to use the combination of "list-inline" and "list-inline-item"
		-> "list-inline" for <ul> element
		-> "list-inline-item" for <li> element



Truncating text content
	> if somehow a text goes beyond the area it is nested, we can use "text-truncate" class

"text-truncate"
	> will truncate the text that goes over the border of element it is nested
	> the text, if it overflows, will be concatenated by "..." at the end
	> ex: This text is trunca...|

EX:
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Description lists</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">A description list is perfect for defining terms.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Term</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Definition for the term.</p>
    <p>And some more placeholder definition text.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Another term</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">This definition is short, so no extra paragraphs or anything.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3 text-truncate">Truncated term is truncated</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">This can be useful when space is tight. Adds an ellipsis at the end.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Nesting</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <dl class="row">
      <dt class="col-sm-4">Nested definition list</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-8">I heard you like definition lists. Let me put a definition list inside your definition list.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>
