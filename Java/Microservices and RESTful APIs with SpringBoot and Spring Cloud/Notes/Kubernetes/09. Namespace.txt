09. Namespace

Namespace
	> resource in K8s used to provide isolations for parts of the Cluster
		- ex: namespace for dev, qa, prod, etc.
	> with this, we can separate the resources of the Cluster for each of the namespaces
		- after creating Namespaces, we can associate resources (ex: deployment, secret, volume) to each and everyone of them
