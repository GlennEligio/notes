05. Playing with Docker Images and Container

Docker commands

1. docker container run <REPOSITORY>:<TAG>
	> used to run a Docker Container based on the Image
	> we can define several command flags to this
		-p {HostPort}:{ContainerPort}
			-> maps a Host port to the Container's Port
			-> with this, we can send request to the Container through the Host port it is mapped
		-d
			-> makes the application inside Docker Container DETACHED to the Container's lifecycle
			-> this means that if we close the app running inside, it will not affect the Container itself

2. docker container ls
	> list the Containers in Docker Engine
	> command flags include:
		-a
			-> shows all Container, including those that are EXITED

3. docker container stop <ContainerID>
	> used to stop a Docker container

3. docker images
	> shows all the Docker images in LOCAL Docker Registry
