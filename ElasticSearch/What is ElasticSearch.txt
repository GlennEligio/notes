ElasticSearch - Characteristics
 > JSON Based DataStore
	- similar to NoSQL database like MongoDB
 > interactions to the ElasticSearch is done through RESTful API calls includes:
	- building indices
	- querying documents
 > application source can be anything, ranging from
	- business data (ex: products, items)
	- logs
	- metric
	- application trace data
 > these data will then be pushed in ElasticSearch as JSON documents in different indices for them
 > in terms of CAP theorem, the ElasticSearch falls in the AP
	- CAP acronyms stands for Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
 
 
ElasticSearch - Comparison vs RDBMS
 > the following table will be the RDBMS terms and their ElasticSearch equivalent
	- Database = Indexes/Indices
	- Tables = Patters/Types
	- Rows = Documents
	- Columns = Fields
	

ELK stack
 > ELK stack, or more recently called Elastic Stack, is a combination of three open source projects, which are:
	- Elasticsearch
	- Logstash
	- Kibana
 > These three application are all developed by Elastic and are used for storing and analyzing logs
 > Even though these are three separate projects, they compliment each other to the extend that they have come to be recognised as one
 
 
ELK stack process flow
		
Beats ------> Logstash ------> Elasticsearch ------> Kibana
 
 
 
Kibana
 > similar to Grafana
 > used to create UI Dashboard
	- these dashboard will be used as the MAIN INTERFACE for monitoring and analyzing data (in this case, the logs)
 > also used to create Widgets/Visualization of the data
	- these widget CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE as well as the data comes in

Logstash
 > an open-source, server side, processing pipeline
 > Logstash have three main jobs:
	1. Input
		- Logstash can receive logs from different sources as its input
		- We typically set up "Beats", an application that we install as  we install in a server to as a client to listen/fetch the logs it gets
	2. Transform
		- Logstash can also transform the logs it receives, ranging from changing formatting to doing structuring to the data
	3. Stash
		- Logstash can send/stash its output to different places. This includes the Elasticsearch
		
Beats
 > Beats is a free and open platform for single-purpose data shippers. 
 > They send data from hundreds or thousands of machines and systems to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

NOTE:
1. There are containers out there (specically container images like Docker images) that we can use to install the complete infrastructure for this in order to test these out in a much smaller scale
