05. OOP - Object literals

VI. Object literals

Object literals
	> Object literals in Javascript are variables whose values are composed of SET OF KEY VALUE PAIRS
	> value passed into Object literals are similar to JSON strings in format
	> to access one of the key value pairs, we can use the dot operator (.)
	> to add new property in Object, we can use dot operator, and assign a value to new property

EX:
// Creating Object literals
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["music", "movies", "sports"],
  address: {
    street: "50 main st",
    city: "Boston",
    state: "MA",
  },
};

// Accessing one of properties of person Object
console.log(person.hobbies[1]);

// Adding new properties into an Object literal
person.email = "jd@mail.com";

console.log(person.email);
