02.2 Container Network Interface (CNI)



Continer Network Interface (CNI)
	> specification to configure network interfaces in Linux Containers
	> Concerned with connecting (adding) and disconnecting (deleting) containers to the network
	> it is a Network Model with connectivity rules:
		1. POD to POD communication is possible WITHOUT using Network Address Translation (NAT)
		2. Node to Pod communication is possible without NAT
		3. IP that a Pod sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as
	> CNI comes with networking plugins like
		- BRIDGE
		- VLAN
		- IPVLAN
		- MACVLAN
		- DHCP
		- host-local
	> Third-part plugins can be used as well like
		- Calico
		- Weave network
		- flannel
		- NSX


Why CNI
	> Networking can be highly environment-specific
	> Different projects seek to solve the networking challenges - with potential overlap
	> Makes standards for common networking


CNI in Kubernets
/opt/cni/bin/ 
	> show all the supported cni pluggins executeables
ls /etc/cni/net.d/ 
	> shows which plugin is used
cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist 
	> (if you are using calico plugin) gives more information about the plugin
