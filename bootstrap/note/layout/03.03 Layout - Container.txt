03.03 Layout - Container


Container
	> Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. 
	> Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. 
	> While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Three types of Containers
.container
	-> sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid
	-> which is "width: 100%" at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint} 
	-> which is "width: 100%" until the specified breakpoint
	-> ex: <div class="container-md"></div> will be "container-fluid" until md breakpoint (720px)
