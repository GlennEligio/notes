Spring Home Controller and View


Development Process - Controller and View

1. Create Controller class 
	> Annotate a Class with @Controller
		- @Controller inherits from @Component
		- because of this, @Controllers are included in the component scans
2. Define Controller method
	> can have any method name
	> return type MUST be String
3. Add Request Mapping to Controller method
	> we MUST annotate it with @RequestMapping
		- @RequestMapping defines the url to be appended to base-url + dispatcher-url to be able to access this method
		- ex: @RequestMapping("/login") , we can access this by going to localhost:8080/login
4. Return the View Name 
	> inside method body, it must return a view name 
		- ex: to have the method navigate to login.jsp, we must return "login"
5. Develop View Page
	> add something inside the body of the view page we want to navigate
