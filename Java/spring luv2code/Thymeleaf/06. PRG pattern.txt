06. PRG pattern


PRG
	> stands for Post-Redirect-Get pattern
	> development approach that prevents duplicate content when submitting forms and provides a more intuitive user interface. 
	> The post-redirect-get pattern allows you to set bookmarks, share URLs, and reload a website that queries and sends form data - without creating duplicate content or near duplicate content.
	> to do this, we will have to do 

1. Send a form data in a POST API endpoint
2. Inside the POST API endpoint, after performing logic in the form data received (e.g. save in db), we will REDIRECT the request
3. The location of request redirect will be a GET mapping API endpoint
