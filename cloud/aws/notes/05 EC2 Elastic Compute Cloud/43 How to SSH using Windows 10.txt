43 How to SSH using Windows 10


Prerequisites
1. Command line interface, either Windows PowerShell or Command Line Prompt
2. .pem key file
3. Full permission to the .pem file (RWX)


Connecting to the EC2 instance through SSH
1. Open the CLI that you want (PowerShell or CMD)
2. Navigate so that you are in the same folder where .pem file is located
3. Execute the command below
	> ssh -i <FILENAME>.pem ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
	> ex: ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@180.190.27.88
	> ex: ssh -i 'EC2 Tutorial.pem' ec2-user@180.03.04.11
4. You should be connected to the EC2 instance, and the CLI shows that you are ec2-user@ip-<IP-ADDRESS>



Setting Permission and Accessibity to the Private .pem key
 > by default, you will receive warning if too many user have FULL CONTROL to the .pem file
 > for this, we will need to configure the permissions to this file
1. Right click on file
2. Select Properties
3. Go to Security tab
4. Click Advanced
5. Copy the owner's email in this window, we will use it later
6. Click Disable inheritance
	> select Remove all option when prompted
7. Add
8. For Object name, pass the email of the Owner
9. For basic permission, select Full Control
10. Click Ok, then Add, and Apply
11. Check the Security properties of the .pem file again, we should only see one User having full control to this file



NOTE:
1. There should be limited access to the .pem file
	> you will get a warning from the Windows if that is not the case
2. If the filename have spaces, single quotes to wrap the filename
	> ex: if EC2 Tutorial.pem, use 'EC2 Tutorial.pem'
3. Default username to use when SSH connecting for AWS EC2 instance is 'ec2-user'
	> we can also use 'root' but it is not recommended
