Java IO - Overview

Java I/O use cases
1. Reading and writing files
2. Communicating over network sockets
3. Filtering Data
4. Compress and Decompress data
5. Writing objects to streams



Streams
	> A stream is an "ordered sequence of bytes of indeterminate length."
		-> this includes both input and output streams
	> Input streams read data from some source
	> Output streams 'write' data


Stream Classes

Subclasses of InputStream and OutputStream

InputStream
	> FileInputStream
	> PipedInputStream
	> FilterInputStream
		-> DataInputStream
		-> BufferedInputStream
		-> LineNumberInputStream
		-> PushbackInputStream
	> ByteArrayInputStream
	> SequenceInputStream
	> StringBufferInputStream

OutputStream
	> FileOutputStream
	> PipedOutputStream
	> FilterOutputStream
		-> DataOutputStream
		-> BufferedOuputStream
		-> PrintStream
	> ByteArrayOutputStream


Data
	> Streams transmit data in bytes

Bit
	> a 0 or 1

Byte
	> composed of 8 bits
	> with a byte, the number size limit for bits is 2^8 or 256
		-> 0 to 255 for unsigned
		-> -128 to 127 for signed
		-> first bit is used to know whether the number is positive or negative, remaining 7 is for number


Data types
1. Bit
	> hold either 0 or 1
2. Byte
	> composed of 8 bits
	> max number it can hold is 255
3. Int
	> composed of 4 bytes
		-> 32 bits
		-> 4294967296 for unsigned
		-> -2147483648 to 2147483647 for signed
4. Long 
	> composed of 8 bytes
		-> 64 bits
		-> 1.844674407x10^19 
		-> -9223772036854775808 to 9223772036854775807



Character Set
	> bytes transmitted in streams represents a character
	> to know which character a byte represents, we will need to use a Character Set
	> examples of these Character Sets are:
		1. ASCII
			-> 7 bit Character set (127)
			-> contains most of English letters
		2. Latin-1
			-> 8 bit Character set (256)
			-> contains most of Latin characters
		3. Unicode
			-> 32 bit character set (4million +)
			-> contain most of the characters from other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc)
			-> currently only occupies a million
			-> sub types includes the UTF-8 and UTF-16



Readers and Writers
	> Readers will convert bytes from the underlying stream into characters
	> Writers will convert characters back into bytes then put those values into the underlying stream



IOExceptions
	> Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred. 
	> This class is the general class of exceptions produced by failed or interrupted I/O operations.
