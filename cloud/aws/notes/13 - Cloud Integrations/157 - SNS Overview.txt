157 - SNS Overview

Amazon SNS

What if you want to send one message to many receivers?
 > We can either do 
	1. Direct Integration
	2. Publisher/Subscriber
 > Ex: Buying Service sending messages to the following:
	- Email notification
	- Fraud service
	- Shipping service
	- SQS Queue
 > If we do the Direct Integration, this would mean that we will need to do FOUR DIFFERENT Direct integration for each of them
 > If we do the Pub/Sub, the Buying Service "publishes" the messages in an SNS Topic
	- the topic, automatically, will be smart enough to send a notification via email
	- request to fraud service
	- request to shipping service
	- message to SQS queue
