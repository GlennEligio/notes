Responsive Images
	> Images in Bootstrap are made responsive with .img-fluid. 	
	> This applies max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

"img-fluid"
	> makes image responsive
	> add following properties
		- width:100%
		- height: auto

ex:
    <div class="container">
      <div style="width: 40%; border: 5px red solid">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/500/300" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
      </div>
    </div>




Image thumbnails
	> In addition to our border-radius utilities, you can use .img-thumbnail to give an image a rounded 1px border appearance.

"img-thumbnail"
	> along with "img-fluid" properties, it will add additional properties like
		1. border of 1px solid gray
		2. border radius of 0.25rem




Image alignment
	> for aligning image in their parent element, we can either
		1. Use helper float classes
			-> if we do this, make sure to use div with "clearfix" class after the float image
		2. Use margin x-axis: auto
			-> mx-auto
		3. Use text align utilities
			-> text-center class
