153 - Cloud Integrations Overview

Section Introduction
 > When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
 > there are two patterns of application communication
	1. Synchronous communication
		- application to application
		- ex: Buying Service <-----> Shipping Service
	2. Asynchronous communication
		- also called Event based
		- happens between application to queue to application
		- ex: Buying Service -> Queue -> Shipping Service
		- in this case, the Buying Service and Shipping Service are "decoupled" because theres a queue in between them to talk to
		
When to use Asynchronous over Synchronous?
 > Synchronous between applications can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
	- ex: What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos where it is usually 10 videos
 > In this case, its better to decouple your application. Below are the example services offered by AWS
	- Simple Queue Service (SQS): queue model
	- Simple Notification Service (SNS): pub/sub model
	- Kinesis: real-time data streaming model
 > These services can scale INDEPENDENTLY from our application!
