93 Storage Gateway Overview


Hybrod Cloud for Storage
 > AWS is pushing for 'hybrid cloud'
 	- part of your infrastructure is on-premises
	- part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
 > This can be due to
	- Long cloud migrations
	- Security requirements
	- Compliance requirements
	- IT strategy
 > S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS/NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises?
	- using AWS Storage Gateway!




AWS Storage Cloud Native Options
1. Block - Amazon EBS, EC2 Instance Store
2. File - Amazon EFS
3. Object - Amazon S3 Glacier




AWS Storage Gateway
 > Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data in S3
 > Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
 > Use cases:
	- disaster recovery
	- backup and restore
	- tiered storage
 > Types of Storage Gateways:
	1. File Gateway
	2. Volume Gateway
	3. Tape Gateway
 > No need to know the types at the exam
	- not included in Scope, Solution Architect are more involved with this
