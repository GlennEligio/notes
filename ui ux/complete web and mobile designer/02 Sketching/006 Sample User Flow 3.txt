006 Sample User Flow 3


Navigation Schemes
 > helps you figure out which options user can choose, the directions they can move in in the various parts of our product
 > helps define navigation and the hierarchy within


3 STRUCTURES
1. Home screen
	> contains welcome message, and profile image
	> contains products featured, and some deals
	> contains bottom sticky bar at the bottom
		- this bar nest several icons for navigation like home
2. Saved page
	> contains products that user "saved" or "favourited"
 	> the product item component may have button to quickly add it on the cart to buy
	> contains sticky bottom navbar, with home and saved icons for navigation
3. Cart page
	> contains list of products that user added for checkout
	> at the bottom, instead of the sticky navbar, we will use checkout button
	> then at the top, we will provide a back button
	> reasoning is that in cart page, the checkout button have higher priority than back button
4. Orders page
	> contains order items that we have
	> these order items contains information like item ordered, status, price, ETA delivery, etc
5. Navbar component
	> the bottom sticky navbar component will have the following icons for specific pages
		- home
		- favorite/saved
		- cart


Creating User flows
 > from the structures and navigation we created earlier, we can now define user flows

Example user flows
1. Home -> Products details page -> Checkout
	> have higher priority
	> happens when user click a featured product in home and check it out immediately
2. Home -> Profile page -> Order screen



Sitemaps
 > a map that contains all the pages/screen in the product and how they are interconnected
 > drawn as a navigation tree


Example sitemaps
1. Home 	-> Items
		-> Category
		-> Interests
2. Saved	-> Item 	-> Cart
		-> Other
		-> Checkout
