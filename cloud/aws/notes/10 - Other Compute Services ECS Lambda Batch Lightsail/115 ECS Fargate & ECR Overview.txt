115 ECS Fargate & ECR Overview

EC2
 > ECS = Elastic Container Service
 > Launch Docker containers on AWS
 > You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
 > AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
 > Has integrations with Application Load Balancer

Diagram: ECS Service
Here, whenever we create a new Docker Container, it will choose which EC2 instance (that we created) will it ran

		New Docker Container
		|	|	|
	|-------|	|	|-------|

	V		V		V
	EC2		EC2		EC2
	Instance	Instance	Instance




Fargate
 > Launch Docker containers on AWS
 > You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) - simpler!
 > Serverless offering
 > AWS just runs containers  for you based on the CPU/RAM you need

ECR
 > Elastic Container Registry
 > Private Docker Registry on AWS
 > This where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate

EC2			
 > contains Image1 and Image2

Fargate
 > Container 1, uses Image2
 > Container 2, uses Image1
