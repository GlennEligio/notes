Different Compute Services of each Cloud Providers

Compute on AWS
Amazon EC2
 > Virtual servers in the cloud
 > EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud
 > Virtual machine that is provisioned on the cloud
 > Starts with its own virtual hard drive and networking
 > Has elasticity, which means it can scale up or down



Compute on Azure
Azure Virtual Machines
 > same concept as Amazon EC2
 > Azure Virtual Machines works by:
	- picking an image (OS, like Ubuntu)
	- select a VM configuration (processor, ram, hard drive)
	- VM get instantiated
	- After this, you will get a virtual machine running in a given zone (you typically need to choose a region before creating a resource)
 	- You can connect to the VM and run apps on it
	- You can also shut it down
	- Lastly, you can terminate/delete it (if you do this, you will not be able to restore data in the VM)
 

NOTE:
1. Cloud providers typically charge you when your VMs are RUNNING
	> shutting down or terminating it will stop the charging
