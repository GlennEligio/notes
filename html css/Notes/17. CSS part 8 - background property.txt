background:url (image-path)
	> for background CSS property, we can also pass IMAGES in it
	> to do this, we will set the value of the property to url()
	> inside the url(), we will pass the path of image in project (for local file) or web url of the image (for online)
		- ex: background:url("./big-image.jpeg"); 
			background:url("./img/folder-image.jpeg");
			background:url("imagewebsite.com/image.jpeg");
			background:url("big-image");
				= NOT PREFERRED, since we mostly want to give RELATIVE path (path that starts with dot)


LAST RULE ORDER	
	> applies to css properties as well
		- if two same css property is defines inside a selector, the latest one will take effect

EX:
div {
 height:400px;
 color:red;
 height:200px;
}
	> in this case, the height:200px; will take effect



background-repeat
	> CSS property that defines how the background image behaves
	> can have values like
		1. repeat
			> default value
			> The background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally.  
			> The last image will be clipped if it does not fit. 
		2. repeat-x
			> The background image is repeated only horizontally
		3. repeat-y
			> The background image is repeated only vertically
		4. no-repeat
			> The background-image is not repeated. 
			> The image will only be shown once
		5. space
			> The background-image is repeated as much as possible without clipping. 
			> The first and last image is pinned to either side of the element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images
		6. round
			> The background-image is repeated and squished or stretched to fill the space (no gaps)




background-size
	> specifies the size of the background images
	> have four syntax of values to use
		a. keyword syntax
			- "auto", "cover", "contain"
		b. one-value syntax
			- sets the width of the image (heights becomes "auto")
			- can be measurement value (em, rem, vw) or percentage values (% of parent element dimension)
		c. two-value syntax
			- sets width and height of image
	> for keywords, the values represents
		a. cover
			- Resize the background image to cover the entire container, even if it has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges
		b. contain
			- Resize the background image to make sure the image is fully visible




background-position
	> CSS property that defines where to put background image inside element
	> have two syntax for values
		1. keyword values
			- center, top, right, bottom, left
			- can combine some of these values (e.g. center top will place img to center top)
		2. percentage values
			- takes two values (x%, y%)
			- starts at top-left
			- 0% 0% will place background img to top left
			- 100% 100% will place background img to bottom right
			- 50% 50% will place background img to center
		3. absolute values
			- takes two values (xpos, ypos)
			- starts at top-left
			- takes measurements like em, rem, px, etc
				= ex: 100px, 100px will place background image 100px away vertically and 100px away horizontally



background-attachment
	> CSS property that defines whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed
	> default value is scroll
	> can have values like
		a. scroll
			- background image will scroll with the page
			- default value
		b. fixed
			- background image will NOT scroll with the page
		c. local 
			- The background image will scroll with the element's contents




background: linear-gradient()
	> creates a background based on the result of linear-gradient function
	> linear-gradient() have the following syntax:
		background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
	> where
		1. direction
			- defines a starting point and a direction
			- to bottom is the DEFAULT VALUE
			- can have values like
				a. directions like to top, to top right, to bottom, etc
				b. angle like 0deg, 50deg, 120deg
					= NOTE: 0deg is at right and moves COUNTERCLOCKWISE
		2. color-stops
			- Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among
			- can take different color values
				a. hex values
				b. rgb
				c. rgba

SHORTHAND METHOD FOR BACKGROUND
	> includes
		1. color overlay
		2. image background to use
		3. background position
		4. background size
		5. background attachment
		6. background repeat

SYNTAX:
	
background: color-or-image position/size attachment repeat

WHERE
color-or-image
	> represents either a background-color or background-image
	> can take either a color (hex, rgb, rgba) or an image (file-path or external web url)
	
NOTE:
1. attachment and repeat order can be interchanged
	EX: either attachment repeat or repeat attachment
2. position/size order CANT BE CHANGED
	> changing their order will make the CSS property not work
		- ex: cover/center instead of center/cover will make the CSS property unfunctional
3. you can have as many values in background shorthand property as possible

EX: 
background: url("./image1.jpg") center|cover fixed no repeat, url("./image2.jpg") center|cover fixed repeat;
