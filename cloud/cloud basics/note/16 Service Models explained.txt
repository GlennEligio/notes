16 Service Models explained


Service Models
1. SaaS
2. IaaS
3. PaaS 	


Software as a Service (SaaS)
 > a way to "rent" a software that is provided by the cloud provider
 > the hardware or infrastructure that runs the said software is handled by the cloud provider themselves
 > ex: Google Docs, Office 365, SAP, ServiceDesk, Oracle ERP


Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 > also known as "Hardware as a Service or Haas"
 > it is a computing infrastructure managed over the internet
 > typically involves "Virtual Machines"
 > Hardware (rent) provisioning
 	- you get the basic unit of hardware, barebone
 > you will be the one to setup the hardware provisioned to you to do what you want
 > ex: AWS EC2



Platform as a Service
 > provides the platform
 > Platform is managed by the provider
	- ex: hardware that runs the platform, the versioning of the runtime used
 > You write the code that runs on the platform
 > Vendor manages the underlying infrastructure
 > ex: JsFiddle, JDoodle



NOTES:
1. Control brings responsibility
	> theres a thing called "Shared Responsibility Model" where in each have their own responsibility based on the things that they control
	> ex: in SaaS, its Cloud's responsibility to maintain hardware that is running the Software. 
	> ex: in IaaS, its Cloud's responsibility to maintain the software that is responsible for creating and starting the hardware/vm, but anything done with it will be the user's responsibility
