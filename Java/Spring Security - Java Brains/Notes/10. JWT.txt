JWT structure
	> JWT consist of three parts	
		- these parts are separated by period (.)
	> consist of three parts
		1. Header
			- defines type of Algorithm and Token type used
			- encoded in base64
		2. Payload
			- consist of any information, but typically it contains
				a. User credentials and identification
				b. Expiration date of token
				c. Creation date of token
			- encoded in base64
		3. Signature
			- encrypted with the Algorithm Type specified in Header part
			- can be verified using the Signature that the Server holds
			- only the Server have access to it

ENCRYPTION METHOD OF Signature
	> here, we will need to pass the Secret key

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  
your-256-bit-secret

) secret base64 encoded

1. HOW SECURE IS JWT IF ITS READABLE TO ANYONE?
	> In JWT, there should be no confidential / sensitive information in JWT
		- ex: password, sss no. , tax id
	> Just enough info for the server to know who the user is
		- ex: username
