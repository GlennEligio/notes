03. Linux list file command

ls <directory-path>
	> used to show contents of the directory path specified
	> not passing a directory path will show content in CURRENT DIRECTORY
	> adding "-l" flag will show the files/folders in LONG LIST format (more details shown)
		ls -l
	> adding "-a" flag will include hidden files in file/folder to show
		ls -a
	> adding "-s" flag will sort the files/folder by size
		ls -s
	> adding "-R" will list files recursively
		- this means it will show not only the files/folder in specified directory, but also the contents of sub-directories
		ls -R

Long list format
	> in this format, not only the filename is shown but also
		- file type
		- file permission
		- number of hard links to the file
		- owner of the file
		- file group
		- size of the file
		- when the file was lost modified
		- name of file and its location


Combining command flag

ls -la 		will display current directory in long list and will include hidden files
ls -ls		will display current directory in long list and sort by size
