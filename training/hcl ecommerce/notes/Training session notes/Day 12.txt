Day 12
Introduction
Years of Experience
Comfortability with J2EE

Name: John Glenn Eligio, Glenn
Experience: 1 year, same experience as Tristan and Doms since we we're deployed in same project
Comfortability with J2EE: I have experience with Spring, but with regards to J2EE technology like Servlets, Filters,  JPA, I am familiar with them but I haven't used them directly



HCL Commerce
	> theres already code to give out of the box functionality
	
WC
	> main application
	> Enterprise Application (EAR)
		- much bigger project
		- inside, there should be many project in terms of .war and .jar files
		
Stores
	> contain the UI, like JSP, HTML
	> .jar files are basically the logic on the UI files like button, form processing
	
WebServiceRouter
WebSphereCommerceServerExtension

Three main .jar files
	> this is where we will mainly do modifications
	> this .ear files are located in
		1. WC		- Logic/Transaction server
		3. search	- Solr
		4. crs		- UI
	> process flow
		1, CRS calls to the Transaction server through REST webservice
	> Transaction server is running inside WebSphere Application Server
	> CRS and Search is running in WebSphere Liberty Server
	
	
webSphere Application Server
	> a very bulky server like Tomcat
	> host the WC / Transaction server
	
WebSphere Liberty Server
	> light weight, can spin up in few minute
	> host the Search and CRS server
	
EX: Page flow for an E commerce
HomePage -> Department Page -> Sub category pages -> PDP


Exercise
1. Change behavior of the AddToCart
	> Check if the quantity is more than 10, dont allow AddToCart
	> If less than 10, allow AddToCart

Steps
1. Open WebSphereCommerceServerExtensionsLogic

WebSphereCommerceServerExtensionsLogic
WebSphereCommerceServerExtensionsData
	> for JPA and Entity beans
	
Commands
	> OOTB, out of the box
	> Servlet receives the request into a Command
	> Command can be a Controller or a Task command
	> Controller Command must return a response, which is typically a View
	
OrderItemAddCmd
	> responsible for adding items to cart
	> we will extend this command to make logic modification
	
Convention package name for custom Controller Command	
	> same package name as the OOTB Command, but instead of "ibm", change it, typically our company name
	
Three main methods of ControllerCmd
	> setRequestProperties
	> validateParameters
	> performExecute
	

CMDREG
	> table that contains all the registered Commands
