62 Amazon FSx Overview

Amazon FSx - Overview
 > Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
 > Fully managed service

Types of Amazon FSx
1. FSx for Luster
2. FSx for Windows File Server
3. FSx for NetApp ONTAP


Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
 > A fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system
 > Built on Windows File Server
 > Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
 > Integrated with Microsoft Active Directory
 > Can be accessed from AWS or your on-premise infrastructure


EX:
1. Below, we can see an example diagram of the AWS FSx for Windows File Server. 
2. The FSx are hosted in a specific region across different AZs. 
3. EC2 instance in the same region can access the FSx to read/write files throught the specific shared file location exposed by the FSs. 
4. Windows Client outside the AWS network can also connect to the FSx through SMB, assumming that they we're given access to the FSx


AWS Region A
 > ECS
   - connects to the FSx through \\fs-1234123adex.example.com\share
 > AZ 1
   > FSx for Windows File Server
	- accessible through \\fs-1234123adex.example.com\share
 > AZ 2
   > FSx for Windows File Server
	- accessible through \\fs-1234123adex.example.com\share


Outside AWS
 > Corporate data center
	- connects to the AWS FSx as well through SMB using a Windows client




Amazon FSx for Lustre
 > A fully managed, high-performance, scalable file storage for High Performance Computing (HPC)
 > The name Lustre is derived from 'Linux' and 'cluster'
 > Used typically for Machine Learning, Analytics, Video Processing, Financial Modeling,...
 > Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, with sub-ms latencies

EX:
1. FSx for Lustre is hosted in a Region
2. Amazon S3 is linked to the FSx Lustre
3. EC2 Compute Instances can connect to the FSx for Lustre to access data
4. Servers outside the AWS can also connect to the FSx for Lustre to access its data, assumming they have access to the AWS Network


AWS Region A
 > Amazon S3
 > Amazon FSx for Lustre
	- link to S3
 > Compute instances (multiple EC2s)
	- connects to FSx for Lustre to access the data

Outside AWS
 > Corporate data center
	- Servers here can also access data in AWS' FSx for Lustre, assumming that they have access to AWS network
