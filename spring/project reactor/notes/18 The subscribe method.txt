18 The subscribe method


subscribe() method overloads

subscribe()
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer, 
	Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer, 
	Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer, 
	Runnable completeConsumer);
subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer, 
	Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer, 
	Runnable completeConsumer, 
	Consumer<? super Subscription> subscriptionConsumer);


NOTES:
1. Consumer inputs can access the item emitted, Throwable that was thrown while emitting the items, or the Subscription returned by the subscribe() method itself
2. The Runnable input will be executed when the onComplete event is thrown by either Mono or Flux
3. The fourth method signature is DEPRACATED, do not use
4. The Subscription returned by subscribe() can be use to dispose/cancel the subscription dynamically
	> this is also what you can access in the "subscriptionConsumer"
