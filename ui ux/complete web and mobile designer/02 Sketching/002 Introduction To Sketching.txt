Sketching
 > Intro
	1. Sketching is a two step process, idea generation and sketch
 > Uses:
	1. Idea generation


Two steps of Sketching
1. Generate and Sketch
	> here in idea generation step, we will approach the new product and generate AS MANY IDEAS that we can
	> it is not uncommon to be missing certain ideas or details
	> main goal is to get ideas out there quickly, does not matter what idea it is
	> we then choose ideas that is most efficient for the task we are trying to solve for
2. Add Details and Refine
	> here, we will add details to the sketches we made earlier
	> its ok to remove some ideas in this stage and thats the point


Process
1. Generate ideas
	> low level details (no colors usually, though we may use some to signify important parts)
	> goal here is to draw BASIC SKETCHES and generate as MANY OPTIONS as we can
2. Refining sketches
	> here, we might create some WIREFRAMES
	> our basic sketches will have more detailed views, mostly the key components
3. Creating Components
	> we define the key components in our wireframes and refine/add more details to them
