57 EC2 Image Builder Overview


EC2 Image Builder 
 > used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or Container images
 > this automates the creation, maintaining, validating, and testing EC2 AMIs
 > we can also run this builder on schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc...)
 > Free service (only pay for the underlying resources used to create the Image)


Example
1. EC2 Image Builder creates a Builder EC2 instance
2. Inside the Builder EC2 instance, the Build Components are applied
	> ex: customizing the software installed on the instance (install java, sql, or customise firewall)
3. New AMI is created after the Builder EC2 instance finish applying the build components
4. The New AMI will then be tested using a Test EC2 instance
5. Inside the Test EC2 instance, Test Suites are running to see if the AMI is working, is secure, or if the application inside is working
6. AMI will the be distributed (can be multiple region)
	> allows our application to be truly global



NOTE:
1. Underlying resources includes the resources used by the EC2 instances used to build and test the AMI
