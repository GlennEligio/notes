Demonstrating AZ Bound of AWS EBS Volumes
1. Create an EBS Volume
2. Make sure the AZ of EBS Volume is different from the AZ of the EC2 instance
3. Go to EBS Dashboard
4. Attach the newly created EBS Volume to the EC2 instance
	> the EC2 instance should not appear in the Instance dropdown since they are in different AZ




Demonstrating Root Volume deletion on EC2 termination
1. Make sure your the "Delete on Termination" of the Root Volume of EC2 instance is set to yes
2. Check the Root Volume of the EC2 instance in EBS Volume Dashboard
	> it should be present for now
3. In EC2 Dashboard, terminate the EC2 instance
4. Check the EBS Volume and wait, the Root volume there should also disappear after EC2 instance is terminated

NOTES:
1. By default, the Root volume assigned to an EC2 instance at launch will be deleted on termination
	> we can uncheck this, which means it will not be deleted and can be attached later on to other EC2 instances
