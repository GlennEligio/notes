10. ReplicaSets

ReplicaSet
	> a resource in K8s
	> ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.
		- from "kubectl explain replicaset"
	> makes sure that a specific number of Pod is running at all times
		- means that DESIRED STATE is equal CURRENT STATE 
	> in ReplicaSet, we will define the DESIRED STATE
		- in this case, the Desired state refers to the MINIMUM amount of Pods that must be running in Cluster
	
EX:  
We define a ReplicaSet where in its desired state is 3 Pod A running. If its currently have 3 Pod A running and we kill one of the Pod A, what will happen is ReplicaSet will create another instance of Pod A to ensure that Desired State is equal to Current State



Commands
Creating ReplicaSet
kubectl apply -f <filename>
	> for ReplicaSet defines inside a yaml file
kubectl create replicaset --image=<ImageName>
	> for ReplicaSet based on an image

Scaling ReplicaSet
kubectl scale replicaset <replicaSetName> --replicas=<INTEGER>
	> scale the replicaset up/down based on the INTEGER passed in --replicas
	> change the desired state to the value passed
