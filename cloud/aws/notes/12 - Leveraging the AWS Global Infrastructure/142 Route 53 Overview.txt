142 Route 53 Overview

Amazon Route 53 Overivew
 > Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
 > DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs
 > Similar to a PHONEBOOK

Common Records in AWS
1. A record (IPv4)
 	> links a hostname to an IPv4 address
	> ex: www.google.com => 12.34.56.78
2. AAAA record (IPv6)
	> links a hostname to an IPv6 address
	> ex: www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
3. CNAME
  	> links a hostname to another hostname
	> ex: search.google.com => www.google.com
4. Alias 
	> links a hostname to an AWS resource (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc...)
	> ex: example.com => AWS resource



Route 53 - Diagram for A Record
1. Web browser sends a DNS Request to Route 53.
2. The Route53 replies with the IP address of specific DNS Request
3. Using the DNS information, the Web browser can send the request using the specified hostname to the correct server
4. Web browser receives response from Application server


   DNS Request (myapp.mydomain.com)
 |--------------------------------------> Route 53
 |      |--------------------------------
 |	| Send back IP: 32.45.67.85 
 |	V (A record: hostname to IP)
Web browser
 ^	|
 |	| HTTP Request IP: 32.45.67.85 
 |	| Host: myapp.mydomain.com
 |	|------------------------------->
 |-------------------------------------- Application Server
	HTTP Response			  IP: 32.45.67.85




Route 53 Routing Policies
 > need to know them at a high-level for the Cloud Practitioner Exam
 
1. Simple Routing Policy
	> no health checks done to the application server
	> when web browser sends a DNS request, Route 53 will reply with the corresponding IP address
2. Weighted Routing Policy
	> used to distribute traffic/load
	> each Application Server have specified 'weight'
	> using this 'weight', Route 53 will determine which App Server will the request be redirected to
3. Latency Routing Policy
	> used to minimize latency
	> checks the location of Request and EC2 instances
	> redirects the request on the closest EC2 instance available
4. Failover Routing Policy
 	> used for Disaster Recovery
	> in this Policy, a Primary and Failover server exist
	> Route 53 will do a health check on Primary periodically
	> when health check failed, it will redirect the request to Failover servers
