141 Why Global Applications


Global Applications
 > A global application is an application delpoyed in multiple geographies
 > On AWS: this could be Regions and/or Edge Locations

Benefits of Global Applications
1. Decreased Latency
 > Latency is the time it takes for a network to react a server
 > It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
 > Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
2. Disaster Recovery (DR)
 > If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)...
 > You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
 > A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
3. Attach protection
 > distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
