Checking the newly created RDS

	- Connectivity & Security
	- Monitoring
	- Logs & events
	- Configuration
	- Maintenance & backups
	- Tags
5. Go to Connectivity & Security
	> in the Security, you should see the Security group created for the RDS
	> click it, and check the Outbound and Inbound rules
	> it should reflect what we set earlier when we created the RDS



Creating a RDS Snapshot
1. Select an RDS
2. Click Actions > Take a snapshot
3. Give it a name - 'demo-snapshot'
	> you can only do this when the Snapshot is Available



Restore an RDS through a Snapshot
1. Select a Snapshot
2. Click Action > Restore Snapshot
3. Fill up the form
4. Create the RDS (we will not do this, instead just cancel it)



Copy an RDS to another Region
1. Select a Snapshot
2. Click Action > Copy snapshot
3. Fill up the form, which include the Region where it will be copied
4. Cancel the form



Clean up
1. Delete Snapshot
2. Delete RDS
	> uncheck the create Final snapshot, and check the agreement checkbox




NOTE:
1. Templates will autopopulate the Settings section
	> ex: if we select 'Free Tier' template, it will lock the DB Instance class to db t2.micro
2. Similar to EBS Snapshot, we also have RDS Snapshots
	> we can create an RDS through an RDS snapshot
	> we can also copy and share the Snapshot to a DIFFERENT REGION
3. RDS Storage can autoscale
4. With RDS, we can easily Monitor its resource consumption like CPU, RAM, and ROM, check the Logs and events, and configure it through the AWS RDS dashboard
