Section 23 - YAML Introduction

125. Introduction to YAML

What is YAML?
 > YAML file is used to represent data, in this case of K8s, configuration data
 
YAML vs JSON vs XML
YAML 
Servers:
	- name: Server1
	  owner: John
	  created: 12232012
	  status: active
	  
JSON
{
	Servers: [
		{
			name: Server1,
			owner: John,
			created: 12232012,
			status: active,
		}
	]
}

XML
<Servers>
	<Server>
		<name>Server1</name>
		<owner>John</owner>
		<created>12232012</created>
		<status>active</status>
	</Server>
</Servers>


YAML
Key Value pair syntax
 > to represent key value pair, we will be using the syntax below
	KEY: VALUE
 > the colon must be followed by space in order to differentiate the key and the value 
 > key value pair of same idention represents key value pair of same level
 
EX:
Fruit: Apple
Vegatable: Carrot
Liquid: Water
Meat: Chicken


Array/List
 > to represent an array, we will first specify the key presenting the array or list, then followed by dash + space/tab + item in the next line
 > syntax is below
	ArrayName:
	-	ArrayItem1
	- 	ArrayItem2
	-	ArrayItem3
	
EX:
Fruits:
-	Orange
-	Apple
-	Banana

Vegetables:
-	Carrot
-	Cauliflower
-	Tomato


Dictionary/Map
 > A dictionary is a set of properties grouped together under an item
 > The syntax for a dictionary is as follows: ObjectKey + colon + (newline + tab/space + keyvalue1) * n
	ObjectKey:
		Key1: Value1
		Key2: Value2
		Key3: Value3
 > The difference between the indentions between each level of keys represents the hierarchy.
	- ex: with example below, the Banana will have properties/fields of Calories, Fat, and Carbs
		Banana:
			Calories: 105
			Fat: 0.4g
			Carbs: 27g
	- ex: with example below, the Banana will have property of Calories. Then the Calories will have properties of Fat and Carbs. This will result in syntax error since the 'Calories' will have both the '105' and the 'Fat and Carbs' as the value, which is not possible
		Banana:
			Calories: 105
				Fat: 0.4g
				Carbs: 27g

EX:
Banana:
	Calories: 105
	Fat: 0.4g
	Carbs: 27g

Grapes:
	Calories: 62
	Fat: 0.3g
	Carbs: 16g
	
	
YAML - ADVANCED
EX: Key Value /Dictionary / List
Fruits:
-	Banana:
		Calories: 105
		Fat: 0.4g
		Carbs: 27g
-	Grape:
		Calories: 62
		Fat: 0.3g
		Carbs: 16g
		

Dictionary vs List vs List of Dictionaries 
 > Dictionary is used to store properties of a single object
	- ex: Color, Price, Model, Transmission of a Car
		Color: Blue
		Model: Corvette
		Transmission: Manual
		Price: $20,000
	- ex: Color, Price, Model (Name and Year), Transmission of a Car
		Color: Blue
		Model: 
			Name: Corvette
			Year: 1995
		Transmission: Manual
		Price: $20,000
 > List is used to store multiple items of same type of object
	- ex: list of cars as color variations as string
		- Blue Corvette
		- Grey Corvette
		- Red Corvette
		- Green Corvette
		- Blue Corvette
		- Black Corvette
 > List of Dictionaries is used to store multiple objects with defined properties inside
	- ex: list of car as color variations with properties
		-	Color: Blue
			Model: 
				Name: Corvette
				Year: 1995
			Transmission: Manual
			Price: $20,000
		-	Color: Grey
			Model: 
				Name: Corvette
				Year: 1995
			Transmission: Manual
			Price: $20,000
		-	Color: Red
			Model: 
				Name: Corvette
				Year: 1995
			Transmission: Manual
			Price: $20,000
		-	Color: Green
			Model: 
				Name: Corvette
				Year: 1995
			Transmission: Manual
			Price: $20,000

NOTES:
1. Dictionaries are unordered properties. This means that the order of the properties does not matter
2. List are ordered collection. The order of the items and objects in this collection will matter
