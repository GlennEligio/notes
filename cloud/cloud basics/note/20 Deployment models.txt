20 Deployment models


Deployment models
 > most describe the architecture and how things are setup and accessed in their application (Cloud provided GUI/Interface)

Deployment models
1. Public cloud
2. Private cloud
3. Hybrid cloud


Public cloud
 > most common understanding of the Cloud service
 > accessed and used via public internet
 > not everything is done publicly
	- for most part, only the access to the services is public (EX: AWS APP)
	- you need to authenticate yourself to use the service, which means you can't access other Accounts AWS resources, only yours
	- data is not shared among users, this are usually encrypted and only the data owner can read/write on it



Private Cloud
 > Cloud services on PRIVATE infrastructure
	- similar to onPrem solution
 	- here, we setup the Cloud infrastructure onprem
 > defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public
 > sometimes called internal or corporate cloud
 > extremely uncommon
 > uses On prem data center
 > benefits includes
	1. benefits on public cloud
	2. additional control and customization available from dedicated resources
	3. higher level of security and privacy through
 > disadvantages include:
	1. company will should cost and accountability of maintenance of private cloud
 > only large companies that supports multiple developers do this
	- developer count must be substantial enought that going private cloud is more economical




Hybrid Cloud
 > mix of private and public cloud
 > typically seen on the companies that undergoes migration strategy (onprem -> cloud) where transition happens gradually
 > as for the new definition of Hybrid Cloud, it is where company uses a mix of public clouds (ex: Azure + AWS)
