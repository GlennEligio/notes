12 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Create hard and soft links

Soft link (shortcut to file)
 > works between file systems
 > allows linking of directories
 > has a new inode number and file permissions
 > permissions are not mirrored
 > has only the path of the original file, not the contents
 > when a soft link is viewed with "ls" command, we will be able to see the original file (softLink -> originalFile)
 > changes in original file will reflect in the shortcut file
 > removing original file will cause error when we use the shortcut file
	- will also reflect in "ls" command which shows error to the shortcut

Hard link (mirror of file)
 > works only within the same filesystem
 > cannot link directories
 > has the same inode number and permissions of original file
 > permissions are updated if we change the permissions of source file
 > has the actual contents of original file, so that you still can view the contents, even if the original file is moved or removed
 > the mirror file and original file will share the same informations like
	- inode
	- permissions
	- size
	- date created
 > removing the original file will not affect the mirror file
 > changes in original file will reflect in mirror file



inode
 > The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. 
 > Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data. File-system object attributes may include metadata (times of last change, access, modification), as well as owner and permission data.
 > A directory is a list of inodes with their assigned names. The list includes an entry for itself, its parent, and each of its children.
 > to see the inode of each files in a directory, use the "ls" command with "-i" option flag
	$ ls -lia


Commands
ln [option] ORIGINALFILE NEWFILE
 > used to create a link of the original file
 > by default, creates a hardlink of the original file
 > options
	-s 	creates a soft link instead of hard link
