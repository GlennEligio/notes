52 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Configure superuser access

Superuser
 > similar to root user, where it have unlimited access to the system, and can make system level changes, unlike the standard users


/etc/sudoers
 > A superuser in Linux is managed via the sudoers file, this is a file that stores the list of the users that can escalate their privileges and what they can escalate it to.
 > Editing that file can only be done by a privileged user and only using "visudo" if you donâ€™t use that application you can irreparably damage your Linux installation.
	$ sudo bash
 	$ visudo /etc/sudoers


/etc/sudoers content syntax
 > user and group have different syntax
 > for user
	User Host = (Runas) Command
 > for group
	(percentsign)Group Host = (Runas) Command
 > ex:
	root ALL=(ALL) ALL
		- this means the root user can run ALL command as ANY user in ANY host
	%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
		- this means that all users in group "wheel" can run any command as any user in all host
	user2 ALL=(root) /bin/ls, /bin/df -h, /bin/date, /sbin/useradd
		- this means that "user2" can execute commands ls,df,date, and useradd as root in all host
		- ex: sudo useradd user5


Giving superaccess to a standard user
1. Add "wheel" as secondary group of the standard user
	$ usermod -aG wheel user5
2. Check if you have permissions of the "wheel" group in the standard user5
	$ su - user1
		- user1 is another privilege user, so this command can only be done by another privilege user



Commands
visudo /etc/sudoers
 > used to open the sudoers file properly
 > any commands to use for editing this sudoers file may cause issues with linux
