08. GitHub authentication using SSH key


SSH key generation
	> the process will create two files
		1. public key
		2. private key

How to generate SSH public and private key
1. Open Windows PowerShell
2. Type the following command in CLI
	> ssh-keygen -t rsa -C glenneligio@gmail.com		
		= -t flag defines the encryption type
		= -C flag defines the username
3. It will prompt you to define which file to save the keys 
	> pass the filename of the key that you want
4. Then it will prompt you for the "passphrase"
	> passphrase stands for password passphrase
	> this is needed to recreate the SSH private-public key
5. Type the same passphrase to finish the generation
6. After the SSH keys generation, go to the location of SSH keys
	> by default, it is in C://User/<username>/.ssh/
	> but in case the file is not there, check the directory you are in when you executed the ssh-keygen command
7. Open the file with same filename as the one you specified earlier AND uses .pub file extension
	> use notepad to open
8. Copy the contents


Adding SSH public key in GitHub
1. Go to GitHub settings
2. Go to SSH and GPG keys
3. Press "New SSH key"
4. Paste the content of ssh-filename.pub to the SSH key section
