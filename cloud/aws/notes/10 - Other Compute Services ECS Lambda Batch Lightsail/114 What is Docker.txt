114 What is Docker


Docker
 > Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
 > Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
 > Apps run the same, regardless of where they're run
	- Any machine
	- No compability issues
	- Predictable behavior
	- Less work
	- Easier to maintain and deploy
	- Works with any language, any OS, any technology
 > Scale containers up and down very quickly (seconds)


Diagram: Docker on an OS
Server (ex: EC2 instance)
 > Docker Daemon
 	> Docker Container 1,2,3
		- runs Java App
	> Docker Container 4,5
		- runs Node JS app
	> Docker Container 6
		- runs MySQL

Diagram explanation
 > Inside a Server, we can run Docker Engine
 > With Docker Engine, we can run multiple Docker Containers
 > Docker Container can run application inside it



Docker Image repositories
 > Docker images are stored in Docker Repositories
 > Public: DockerHub 
	- https://hub.docker.com/
 	- here you can find base images for many technologies for OS
	- some of these images are OFFICIALLY provided by companies
	- ex: Ubuntu, MySQL, NodeJS, Java
 > Private: Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)




Docker versus Virtual Machines (VMs)
 > Docker is "soft of" a virtualization technology, but not exactly
 > Resources are shared with the host => many containers on one server
