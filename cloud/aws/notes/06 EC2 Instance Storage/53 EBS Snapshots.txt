53 EBS Snapshots


EBS Snapshots
 > a "backup" (snapshot) of an EBS volume at a point in time
 > recommended to detach volume first before snapshot, but not necessary	
 > can copy snapshot across AZ or Region
	- this means that after snapshotting, we can use the Snapshot to populate EBS Volumes from different regions or AZ


EX:
US-EAST-1A
EC2 A
 > EBS #1 -> snapshotted, resulted in Snapshot #1

US-EAST-1B
EC2 B
 > EBS #2 <- populated with data using Snapshot #1
