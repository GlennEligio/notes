DCL Commands
	> used to grant or revoke privileges to the user

For us to use DCL commands, we must first create a user. To be able to create a user we need LOGIN.

Syntax for creating LOGIN:

	CREATE LOGIN logInName WITH PASSWORD = 'passWord'

Example:

	CREATE LOGIN SAMPLELOGIN WITH PASSWORD = 'glenn'

Now we can CREATE a USER that will use this LOGIN.

Syntax for creating USER:

	CREATE USER userName FOR LOGIN logInName;

Example:

	CREATE USER GLENN FOR LOGIN SAMPLELOGIN;


GRANTING/REVOKING Privileges

Syntax:
GRANTING Privileges

	GRANT Privilege ON TableName TO userName;

REVOKING Privileges

	REVOKE Privilege ON TableName TO userName;

Example:

	GRANT SELECT ON StudentsInfo TO GLENN;
	REVOKE SELECT ON StudentsInfo TO GLENN;

These will GRAND/REVOKE the SELECT clauses to the StudentsInfo table to USER GLENN.

Also, to be able to see the USERS and their PRIVILEGES, you can go to
	
	Databases > DatabaseName > Security > Users
