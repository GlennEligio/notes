82 S3 Server Access Logging

S3 Access Logs
 > for audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets 
 > Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket
 > That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools
 > This will be very helpful to come down to root cause of an issue, or audit usage, view suspicious patterns, etc
	- ex: check what is the cause of unintended deletion of files
