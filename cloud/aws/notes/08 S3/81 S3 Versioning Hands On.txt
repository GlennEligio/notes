81 S3 Versioning Hands On


Delete Marker
 > when we delete an Object with only ONE version, instead of deleting it permanently, the S3 Bucket will add a 'Delete marker' to it
 > 'Delete marker' will be new version on top of the said deleted Object
 > We can delete this 'Delete marker' version of the Object to restore the Object
 > to delete PERMANENTLY, turn on the 'Show versions' and delete all the versions



Enabling Versioning
1. Go to the Bucket > Properties tab > Bucket Versioning section
2. Click Edit, and select Enable
3. Save changes


Demonstrating Versioning at Object level
1. Modify the HTML file you upload earlier
	> change it so that we will know if the html rendered is different
2. Upload it again in the same directory in the Bucket
	> make sure it have the same name as well
3. Check the URL exposed by S3 Website hosting if its different
4. Check the directory of the HTML file in the S3 Bucket\
5. In the Objects tab of S3 Bucket, turn on the 'Show versions' checkbox
	> you should see that the HTML file have two items, one is null and one is a random string
	> initially, all Objects in Bucket will have version of null if they are uploaded BEFORE versioning is turned on
6. Delete the newer version
7. Check the URL again to see if the changes reflected in the HTML page rendered



Demonstrating Delete Marker
1. Turn off 'Show versions' to use this feature
2. Delete one of the Objects
	> delete the image used in the HTML file
3. Turn on 'Show version' again
