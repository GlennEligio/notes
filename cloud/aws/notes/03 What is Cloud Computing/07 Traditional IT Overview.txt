07 Traditional IT Overview

How Websites work
 > Application (i.e. webapps) are hosted in a remote Server
 > Client will send request to the Server (as packets of data) through the Network
 > In order for the Client and Server to know each other's location in the Network, both Client and Server uses IP addresses, which is similar on how normal addressed work
	- this way, Client know where to send a request, and Server knows where to send the response
 > Using real life mailing system, we can make an analogy where
	- Client serves as the sender of mail
	- Server serves as the receiver of mail
	- Network will be the post office
	- IP addresses will be the sender and receiver address



What is a server composed of?
 > CPU - for computation
 > RAM - for short term memory storage
 > Data - for long term memory storage
 > Database - for storing data in a structure way, where we can query later
 > Routers, switch, DNS server - for networking 



IT Terminologies
Network 
 > cables, routers, and servers connected with each other
Router
 > A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
 > They know where to send your packets on the internet!
Switch
 > takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network


Structure
 > note that server and client here can be interchangable, since the Client might able be managed under a Router and a Switch

				     |--- Server
Client -----> Router -----> Switch --|--- Server
				     |--- Server


Traditional IT Infrastructure
 > uses On-premises data centers
 > worked for so many years

Problems with Traditional IT approach
 > Pay for the rent for the data center
 > Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
 > Scaling is limited
	- to scale, we need to buy new servers
	- but with new servers comes the need for more space, power supply, and maintenance
 > Needs to hire 24/7 team to mointor the infrastructure
 > Needs to be able to deal with disasters (earthquake, power shutdown, fire)




NOTE:
1. Cloud resources, typically server resource like CPU, RAM, Data or even the server itself, is served by the Cloud ON DEMAND.
