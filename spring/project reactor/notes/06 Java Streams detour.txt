06 Java Streams detour

Java streams
 > represent a sequence of data
 > focus on computations
 > unlike Collection which focus on storage
 > iteration happens internally

EX:
// iterator through numbers array, and print all of them
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
number.stream().forEach(number -> System.out.println(number));


Some Stream operations
1. map		- map the Stream element into another form
2. filter	- filter Stream element based on condition
3. flatMap	- collects all the element of "Stream" returned, and "flatten" it so that all of them will be in a single Stream
4. findFirst	- find the first element that matches the Predicate given


Exercise prerequisite
1. Java 9 and above
2. IntelliJ or VSCode
3. Git CLI
