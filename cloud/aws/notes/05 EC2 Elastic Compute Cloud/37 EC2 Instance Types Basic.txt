37 EC2 Instance Types Basic

EC2 Instance Types
 > can be seen here: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
 > left side is the Instance types, which the tabs on right refers to the families
 > this includes	
	- General Purpose
	- Compute Optimized
	- Memory Optimized
	- Accelerated Computing
	- Storage Optimized
	- Instance Features
	- Measuring Instance Performance



EC2 Instance Naming Convention
	
	m5.2xlarge

m: instance class
5: generation (since AWS improves them over time)
2xlarge: size within the instance class




EC2 Instance Types descriptions
General Purpose
 > greate for diverse workloads such as web servers or code repositories
 > balance between:
	- Compute
	- Memory
	- Networking
 > in this course, we will be using t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance included in free tier



Compute Optimized
 > create for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
 > this includes:
	- Batch processing workload
	- Media transcoding
	- High performance web servers
	- High performance computing (HPC)
	- Scientifiy modeling & machine learning
	- Dedicated gaming servers



Memory Optimized
 > Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
 > Use cases includes:
	- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
	- Distributed web scale cache stores
	- In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
	- Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructed data



Storage Optimized
 > greate for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
 > use cases:
	- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
	- Relational & NoSQL databases
	- Cache for in-memory databases (ex: Redis)
	- Data warehousing applications
	- Distributed file systems
