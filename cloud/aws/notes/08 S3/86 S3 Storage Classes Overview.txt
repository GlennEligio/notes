S3 Durability and Availability
Durability
 > Durability refers to the chances that AWS will NOT lose an Object
 > High durability (99.9999999%, 11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ
 > If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
 > Same for ALL Storage classes


Availability
 > Measures how readily available a service is
 > Varies depending on storage class
 > ex: S3 standard has 99.99% availability
	- not available 53 minutes a year



S3 Standard - General Purpose
 > 99.99% availability
 > Used for frequently accessed data
 > Low latency and high throughput
 > Can sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
 > Use cases:
	- Big data analytics
	- Mobile & gaming applications
	- Content distribution



S3 Storage Classes - Infrequent Access
 > for data that is less frequently access, but requires rapid access when needed
 > lower cost than S3 Standard
 > two types:
	- S3 Standard-IA
	- S3 One Zone-IA

Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequenct Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
 > High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9s) in a SINGLE AZ

 > 99.5% Availability
 > Use cases:
	- Storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or data you can recreate



Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
 > low cost object storage meant for archiving/backup
 > pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost
 > three types
	- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrival
	- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrival
 > Milisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
 > Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost
Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier)
 > Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free

	- only on the tier that are labelled 'automatic' below
 > There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
 > different tiers are indicated below:
   - Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
   - Infrequent Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
