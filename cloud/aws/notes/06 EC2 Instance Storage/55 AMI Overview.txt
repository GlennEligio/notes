55 AMI Overview

AMI Overview
 > AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image
 > AMI are a CUSTOMIZATION of an EC2 instance
	- you add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
	- faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
 > AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across region)
 > you can launch EC2 instances from:
	- A Public AMI: AWS provided
	- Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
	- An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)



AMI Creation Process (from an EC2 instance)
1. Start an EC2 instance and customize it
2. Stop the instance (for data integrity)
3. Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots behind the scene
4. Launch instances from other AMIs

EX:
US-EAST-1A
 > EC2 A ---> used to create AMI #1

us-EAST-1B
 > EC2 B ---> launched using AMI #1



NOTE:
1. It is common for some software vendors to create their own AMI, with their own software and nice customizatino, and sell it to AWS Marketplace AMI
