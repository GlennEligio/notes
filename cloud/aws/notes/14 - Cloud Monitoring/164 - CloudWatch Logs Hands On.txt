Parts:
1. CloudWatch Logs dashboard
2. Demo using Lambda


CloudWatch Logs dashboard
1. go the CloudWatch Dashboard
2. At the left side, go tO "Log groups"
	> this is where we can see all the log groups, which can be created by CloudWatch log agent or some AWS resource (ex: Lambda)
	
	
Demo of CloudWatch Logs using Lambda
1. Go to AWS Lambda
2. Create a Lambda where the script/code will print something in the console
	> for python script, we can use print() function
	> by default, the Lambda will create a Log group for itself
	> for each test/run of the AWS Lambda, it will create a Log stream for the Log group that it assigned to itself
3. Run/Test the AWS Lambda
4. Check the Log group created by the Lambda
	> go to the CloudWatch dashboard > Log groups
		- we should see the Log group for the Lambda
	> click the Log group
		- inside, we can see the Log stream generated for each Run/Test of the AWS Lambda that we just created
