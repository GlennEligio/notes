~~~~~ COMPONENTS - ALERTS ~~~~~
Alerts
	> used to provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.	
	> typically have the following
		1. Alert header (RARE)
		2. Alert content
		3. Button for closing the alert (needs Bootstrap JS alert plugin)

Creating Alert
1. Add "alert" to the element
2. Add "alert-{color}" to decorate the alert
3. Add role="alert" for ARIA

Optional
1. "alert-heading" for the element to be used for alert heading
2. "alert-link" for links inside the alert
	-> this will make the link inherit the properties of alert (specifically COLOR)
3. Specify the alert icon by adding element inside the "alert"


Dismissing an alert
	> needs to have the alert JS plugin
1. Add a close button
2. Add "alert-dismissible" class to the "alert" element
	> adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the close button
3. Add "data-bs-dissmiss="alert"" attribute to the close button
	> triggers the JS functionality
	> be sure to use button element
4. Add "fade" or "show" to add animations to alert
	> fade for adding fade effect when closing
	> show for adding show effect when closing
