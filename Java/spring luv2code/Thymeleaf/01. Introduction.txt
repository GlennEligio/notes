01. Thymeleaf

Thymeleaf
	> Thymeleaf is a Java templating engine
	> Commonly used to generate the HTML views for web apps
	> However, it is a general purpose templating engine
		- can use Thymeleaf for non-web purposes
	> Have a lot of synergy between the Spring Framework and Thymeleaf
		- this is the reason why they are often mentioned together
	> To use the Thymeleaf in Spring, Spring Boot provides a Starter dependency for it


Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf dependency

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency>


NOTES:
	- You can create Java apps with Thymeleaf (No need for Spring)
	- Thymeleaf is a separate project, unrelated to spring.io


Thymeleaf template
	> can be an HTML page with some Thymeleaf expression
		- include dynamic content from Thymeleaf expressions
	> process on the SERVER
		- results included in HTML return to browser
	> Thymeleaf templates files go in 
		- src/main/resources/templates


Thymeleaf vs JSP
	> similar to JSP
		- can be also used for web view templates
	> but theres one key DIFFERENCE
		- JSP can ONLY be used in a web environment
		- Thymeleaf can be used in web OR non-web environments
	> Unlike JSP, you DONT need to provide PREFIX and SUFFIX for ViewResolver in application.properties
		- If you have Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf, it will AUTOMATICALLY search for templates in src/main/resources/templates
	> HTML is generated dynamically
		- the Thymeleaf expression is not displayed in the page sources
		- it is replaced by the actual value of the Thymeleaf expression itself
		- in example below, we can see the ${theDate} is not shown but instead that actual value shown in browser itself

EX:
INSIDE browser html page source

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Thymeleaf Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Time on the server is Wed Dec 15 17:27:12 CST 2021</p>
</body>
</html>

INSIDE the html file in project

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Thymeleaf Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p th:text="'Time on the server is ' + ${theDate}"/>
</body>
</html>

FAQ: Should I use JPS or Thymeleaf?
	> Depends on your project requirements
	> If you only need web views, you can go either way
	> If you need a general purpose tempalte engine (non-web), use Thymeleaf
