35 EC2 Basics


Amazon EC2
 > EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering
 > EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud
 > a way to do Infrastructure as a Service in AWS
 > it mainly cosists in the capability of:
	- renting Virtual Machines (EC2 instances)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS volumes)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB - Elastic Loadbalancer)
	- Scaling the services (ASG - Auto-scaling group)
 > Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works



EC2 sizing & configuration opti ons:
1. Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
2. How much compute power & cores (CPU)
3. How much random access memory (RAM)
4. How much storage space:
	- Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	- Hardware (EC2 instance storage)
5. Network card: speed of the card, public IP address
6. Firewall rules: Security groups
7. Bootstap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data



EC2 User Data
 > with EC2 User data script, we can BOOTSTRAP our instances
 	- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
 > this scripts is only run ONCE at the instance FIRST start
 > EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- installing updates
	- installing software
	- downloading common files from the internet
	- anything you can think of
 > The EC2 User data scripts runs with the root user of EC2 instance



Example EC2 instance types:
t2.micro
 > 1 vCPU, 1Gib memory, EBS-Only storage, Low to moderate network performance, and no EBS Bandwidth
t2.xlarge
 > 4 vCPU, 16Gib memory, EBS-Only storage, Moderate network performance, and no EBS Bandwidth
c5d,4xlarge
 > 16 vCPU, 32Gib memory, 1x400 NVMe SSD storage, Up to 10Gbps, and 4750Mbps EBS Bandwidth
r5.16xlarge
 > 64 vCPU, 512Gib memory, EBS-only storage, Up to 20Gbps, and 13600Mbps EBS Bandwidth
m5.8xlarge
 > 32 vCPU, 128Gib memory, EBS only storage, Up to 10Gbps, and 6800Mbps EBS Bandwidth


NOTE:
1. t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)
