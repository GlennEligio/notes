11. Introduction to Distributed Tracing

Problems with Microservices
1. Complex call chain
2. Debugging problems
2. Tracing request across microservices

Solution
Distributed Tracing
	> in Distributed Tracing, all the microservices all send ALL information out to a SINGLE Distributed Tracing Server
	> The Distributed Tracing Server will then store everything to a Database
		- this database can be either in-memory or a real Database
	> The Distributed Tracing Server will provide you an INTERFACE which allows you to trace the request across multiple microservices
	> Example of Distributed Tracing Server is Zipkin
