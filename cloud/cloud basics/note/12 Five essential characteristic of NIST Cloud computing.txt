12 Five essential characteristic of NIST Cloud computing

Five essential characteristic
1. On-demand self service
2. Broad Network Access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid Elasticity
5. Measured Service



Essential Characteristic
On-demand self service
 > evident in current Cloud providers today
 > this means that there is 
	- no provisioning of hardware or looking at prices, calling the hardware dealer to get a quote, ordering the hardware, shipping the hardware
 > on-demand as in you can get it when you need it
 > self service as in you don't need anyone to get the hardware resources to you



Broad Network Access
 > essentially boils down to having all the Services available and accessible in the Internet
 > common exception includes some Enterprises that don't want to their cloud solution or applications to be available online and public
	- ex: firewalls


Resource pooling
 > in On Prem, there's no such thing as Resource pooling, the hardware is entirely yours
 > in Cloud, they do Resource pooling where in the resource of a single hardware is shared to different Users
 	- this doesn't mean that other Users can access your resources (ex: data)
	- theres a strict separation as to what you provision
	- the underlying hardware itself is pooled



Rapid elasticity
 > elasticity means that we can change the resources used based on what user wants
 > with Cloud computing, it must be able to quickly/rapidly adapt to the changes the User did to the provisioned hardware resource



Measured service
 > typically seen in the pay-as-you-go model that is used by most cloud providers
 > all Services that Users consume is metered
 > different Cloud providers have different way of measuring the services (ex: time, resource used)
