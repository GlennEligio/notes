20. Docker Swarm - Backup and Restore

Create a backup of the Docker Swarm component
1. Stop the docker first
	systemctl stop docker
2. Create a compressed .tar file of the swarm folder of /var/lib/docker with name "swarm.tar.gz"
	cd /var/lib/docker
	tar -zcvf swarm.tar.gz swarm/
3. Remove the swarm folder
	rm -ifr swarm/
4. Start the docker again
	systemctl start docker
5. Check the nodes in Docker Swarm (this should be empty)
	docker node ls

Restore the Swarm component using the backup
	> to restore Swarm properly, swarm/ folder in /var/lib/docker SHOULD BE PRESENT BEFORE STARTING DOCKER
1. Stop Docker for now
	systemctl stop docker
2. Extract the contents of .tar.gz file backup
	tar -xvzf swarm.tar.gz
3. Start the Docker again
	systemctl start docker
4. Check the nodes of Swarm again (this time, there should be Nodes present)
	docker node ls
