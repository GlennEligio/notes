	> Filters are included in the J2EE technology

Spring Security default behavior
	> once the Spring Security is added in the classpath, it will exhibit the following behaviors by default

1. Adds a mandatory authentication for URLs
	> affects ALL URL mappings in the project EXCEPT "/error" of Spring Boot 
	> "/error" is the landing page of project whenever it encounters an error

2. Adds a login form
	> all URL mappings will redirect users to this login form IF they are not Authenticated/Authorized

3. Handles login error


4. Creates a user and sets a default password
	> the default user is "user"
	> the default password is shown in the console



OVERRIDING THE DEFAULT USER-PASSWORD of Spring Security

In application.properties, define the following variables

spring.security.user.name=username
spring.security.user.password=password

EX:
spring.security.user.name=john
spring.security.user.password=testpassword
