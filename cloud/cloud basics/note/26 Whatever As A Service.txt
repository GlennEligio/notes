26 Whatever As A Service


Things to consider when considering Cloud vs On-prem
1. Cloud Services have NO OWNERSHIP
	> in essence you are paying for a service over time
	> this means that when you stop paying for it, you get nothing, even the resources you use
2. Buy vs Rent Hardware
	> for Cloud, you are "renting" the hardware like in on-prem, you are buying it
	> for "renting", it will be 
		- low-upfront cost
		- in the long run, it will be more expensive	
		- you will get nothing when you stop renting
	> for buying, it will be 
		- high-upfront cost 
		- in the long run, it will be less expensive
		- you will still own the hardware when you stop using it
3. Computer hardware depreciation
 	> relevant to when you buy hardware
	> while you can sell the hardware to get some of the upfront cost back, it will most likely depreciated in price overtime
