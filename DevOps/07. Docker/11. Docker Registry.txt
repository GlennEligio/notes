11. Docker Registry

Docker Images Registry
	> serves as a repository for images
	> types of repository includes
		1. Local registry
			- images are stored in local machine for caching
		2. Remote registry
			- images are stored outside local machine
			- to fetch images inside this registry, we will use docker pull command
			- types of Remote registry includes
				a. Private registry
					- Docker registry running in the Local machine
				b. Global registry
					- Docker registry running outside local machine / global



Docker Registry
	> a registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images available in different tagged version
	> Docker Registry itself is a Docker image
			

docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 --name local_registry registry
	> used for creating a Docker Registry locally
	> since Docker Registry is an Image itself, we will use the "run" command
	> also, we must set the specific port of the container
	> "-d" since we would want to be in dettached mode (background)


docker push <machine ip:tcp port>/<image name>
	> used for pushing an Image in the Local Docker Registry
	> same as to when we push an Image in dockerhub registry
	> except we will use the <machine ip>:<tcp port mapped to docker registry>
		- ex: docker push localhost:5000/web

docker pull <machine ip:tcp port>/<image name>
	> used for pulling an Image in the Local Docker Registry
	> same as to when we pull an Image in dockerhub registry
	> except we will use the <machine ip>:<tcp port mapped to docker registry>
		- ex: docker image pull localhost:5000/web



ACCESS PRIVATE DOCKER REGISTRY
1. Using CLI
	curl localhost:5000/v2/_catalog
	curl <machine's public ip>:5000/v2/_catalog
		- ex: curl 29.123.242.123:5000/v2/_catalog

2. Using External Browser
	http://<machine's public ip>:5000/v2/_catalog
		- ex: http://29.123.242.123:5000/v2/_catalog


3. In the Local machines directory
	> inspect the Container where Docker registry image is running
		docker container inspect local_registry
	> go to "Mounts" section of docker inspect output
	> check the "Source" value
	> go to this directory
		cd <Source>/docker/registry/v2/repositories
