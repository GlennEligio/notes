91 AWS Snow Family Overview

AWS Snow Family
 > Highly-secure, portable devices to 
	1. collect and process data at the edge, and 
	2. migrate data into and out of AWS

Data Migration:
1. Snowcone
2. Snowball Edge
3. Snowmobile

Edge computing:
1. Snowcone
2. Snowball Edge



Why use AWS Snow Family for Data Migration
 > with AWS Snow Family, offline devies are used to perform data migrations
 > if it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!
 > below is the table when we do a data migration through a Network

Network Transfer
			Time to Transfer
Network Speed		100Mbps		1Gbps		10Gbps
Size to transfer
10TB			12days		30hours		3hours
100TB			124days		12days		30hours
1PB			3 days		124days		12days


Challenges of Data Migration through a network
 > Limited connectivity
 > Limited bandwidth
 > High network cost
 > Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
 > Connection stability

Snowball Edge (for data transfers)
 > Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
 > Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
 > Pay per data transfer job
 > two types of Snowball Edge
	1. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
	2. Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
 > Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
	- 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
 > Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
	- 42 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
 > Use cases:
	- large data cloud migrations
	- DC decommission
	- disaster recovery



AWS Snowcone
 > Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
 > Light (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
 > Device used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer
 > 8 TBs of usable storage
 > Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space-constrained environment)
 > Must provide your own battery/cables
 > Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data




AWS Snowmobile
 > Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
 > Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
 > High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
 > Better than Snowball if you transfer MORE THAN 10 PB of data



AWS Snow Family for Data Migrations
Snowcone
 > Storage capacity: 8TB usable
 > Migration Size: Up to 24TB, online and offline
 > DataSync agent: Pre-installed
 > Storage Clustering: N/A

Snowball Edge
 > Storage capacity: 80TB usable
 > Migration Size: Up to petabytes
 > DataSync agent: N/A
 > Storage Clustering: Up to 15 nodes

Snowmobile
 > Storage capacity: < 100 PB
 > Migration Size: Up to exabytes, offline
 > DataSync agent: N/A
 > Storage Clustering: N/A



Snow Family - Usage Process
1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you're done (goes to the right AWS facility using an E-Ink marker)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped




What is Edge Computing?
 > Process data while its being created on an edge location
	- ex: A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
 > These locations may have
	- limited / no internet access	
	- limited / no easy access to computing power
 > We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
 > Use cases of Edge Computing:
	- Preprocess data
	- Machine learning at the edge
	- Transcoding media streams
 > Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)




Snow Family - Edge Computing
Snowcone (smaller)
 > 2 CPUs, 4GB of memory, wired or wireless access
 > USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized
 > 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
 > Optional CPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
 > 42 TB usable storage
Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized
 > Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
 > Object storage clustering available

NOTE:
1. All Snow family can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda function (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
2. Theres a long-term deployment options which includes 1 and 3 years discounted pricing




AWS OpsHub
 > Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
 > Today, you can use AWS OpsHub to manage your Snow Family Device
	- AWS OpsHub is a software that you can install on your computer/laptop
	- Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
	- Transferring files
	- Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
	- Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
	- Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System(NFS))
