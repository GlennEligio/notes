124 CloudFormation Overview


CloudFormation
 > CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
 > For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
	- I want a security group
	- I want two EC2 instances using this security group
 	- I want an S3 bucket
	- I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
 > Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the RIGHT ORDER, with EXACT CONFIGURATION that you specify



Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
1. Infrastructure as code
 > No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
 > Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
2. Cost
 > Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
 > Saving strategy: In Dev, you could automate deletion of templates at 5PM and recreate at 8AM, safely
3. Productivity
 > Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
 > Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
 > Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
4. Don't re-invent the wheel
 > Leverage existing templates on the web!
 > Leverage the documentation
5. Support (almost) all AWS resources
 > Everything we'll see in this course is supported
 > You can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported
