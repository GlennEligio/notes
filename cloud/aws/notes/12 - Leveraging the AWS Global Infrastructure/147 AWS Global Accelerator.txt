Without Global Accelerator
 > here, the request hops to multiple network which introduces latency

User ---> Local ISP ----> Network A ----> B ---> C --> AWS Region


With Global Accelerator
 > here, the request goes to the Edge location ASAP in order to go to private AWS network, which makes the request much faster

User ---> Local ISP ---> Edge ---------------> AWS Region		
				AWS Network




AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
 > they both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
 > both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection

CloudFront - Content Delivery Network
 > improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
 > content is SERVED AT THE EDGE

Global Accelerator
 > no caching, PROXYIN PACKETS at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions
 > Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
 > Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP address
 > Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
