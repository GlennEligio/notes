03. Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes
	> Container Orchestration tool
	> A Resource Manager, which manages resources like Servers (Physical / Virtual)
	> Different Cloud providers have different names for these Virtual Servers
		- Amazon  	-> Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	
		- Azure		-> Virtual Machines (VM)
		- Google Cloud	-> Compute Engine
	> Kubernetes calls these Servers with a generic name "Nodes"


Kubernetes Architecture
1. Cluster
	> composed of nodes, which is divided into two groups
		a. Master Node(s)
			- manages Cluster, making sure Worker Nodes are up
			- this Node needs to have at least 2 CPU
			- a Cluster must have at least ONE Master Node
				-> but for redundancy and high availability, we can deploy more than one Master Node
		b. Worker Node(s)
			- this nodes typically run all Pods/Containers that contain the application



Services and Ingress
Services
	> a K8s resources used to expose a specific Pod/ReplicaSet/Deployment
	> we can expose them in Cluster either INTERNALLY or EXTERNALLY
