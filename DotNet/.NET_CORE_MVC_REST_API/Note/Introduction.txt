Application Architecture composes of the following Components
1. Model
	> represents the Data inside the Database (Internal)
2. Controller
	> manages the Requests and Actions
	> typically we should have 1 Controller per Resource type
3. Program and StartUp classes
4. DB Context
	> serves as mediator between the Database itself and the Web API
5. Repository
	> for persistence ignorance
6. Data Transfer Objects
	> converts the Model data into something that we will send to API Client (External)
