17. Adding RabbitMQ as protocol for sending Zipking calls

RabbitMQ
	> RabbitMQ is one of the most widely used open-source message brokers. 
	> It was originally based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). 
	> Later on, it has been modified to support Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), and several other common protocols. 
	> RabbitMQ has been designed to be used for a variety of messaging scenarios that have developed over the last 25 years. 
	> It is well-known for Reliability and Interoperability. 
	> It has been implemented in many languages; therefore, it is one of the best choices for building reliable, large scale, clustered, resilient messaging infrastructure.



Setting up RabbitMQ server
1. Create Docker Service to host rabbitmq
	> image will be rabbitmq:latest
	> memory limit to 300mb
	> ports to open are
		a. 5672		- Communication port
		b. 15672	- Management port




Setting up the MicroServices by adding RabbitMQ as protocol for sending Zipkin calls
1. Add required dependencies
	> Zipkin-related dependencies	
		a. spring-cloud-starter-sleuth
		b. spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin
			- both from org.springframework.cloud
	> RabbitMQ dependency
		a. spring-rabbit 
			- from org.springframework.amqp

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin</artifactId>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.amqp</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-rabbit</artifactId>
		</dependency>



2. Setup the required configuration properties 
	> this is for services that will send trace to Zipking through RabbitMQ
	> as for the zipkin server, it only needs the rabbit.uri

	a. spring.zipkin.sender.type=rabbit
		> defines how we will send trace calls
		> can be web, rabbit, or kafka, based on the how we send traces
		> by default, we send the spans to Zipking through web (HTTP)
	b. spring.rabbitmq.host=rabbitmq
		> defines the ip address of the server that host the RabbitMQ server
		> in our case, it is being ran in "rabbitmq" Docker Server, we will pass its name
	c. rabbit.uri= amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672
		> defines the uri where the RabbitMQ will send/redirect the trace calls
		> in our case, we will send it in rabbitmq at port 5672, with user and pass "guest", using amqp protocol


3. Setup the Docker Service
	> modify the depends_on property of Service since we added rabbitmq
	> use it on all services except rabbitmq and naming server
