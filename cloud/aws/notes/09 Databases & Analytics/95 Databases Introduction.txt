95 Databases Introduction

Database Intro
 > storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits
 > Sometimes, you want to store data in a database where:
 	- You can structure the data
 	- You build indexes to efficiently query/search through the data
 	- You can define relationships between your datasets
 > Database are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints




Types of Databases
1. Relational Databases
2. No-SQL databases




Relational Database
 > looks just like Excel spreadsheets, with links between them!
 > can use the SQL language to perform queries/lookups

Ex:
Student ID	Dept ID		Name 		Email
1		M01		Joe Miller	joe@abc.com
2		B01		Sarah T		sarah@abc.com

Student ID	Subject
1		Physics
1		Chemistry
1		Math
2		History
2		Geography
2		Economics

Dept ID	SPOC		Email		Phone
M01	Kelly Jones	kelly@abc.com	+123475678

NoSQL Databases
 > NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases
 > NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data moedls and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
 > Benefits
	- Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
	- Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
	- High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
	- Highly functional: types optimized for the data model
 > Examples: Key-value, Document, Graph, In-memory, Search databases


JSON: NoSQL data example
 > JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
 > JSON is a common form of data that fits into a NoSQL model
 > Data can be nested 
 > Fileds can change over time
 > Support for new types: arrays, another JSON, etc

EX:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "cars": [
    "Ford",
    "BMW",
    "Fiat"
  ],
  "address": {
    "type": "house",
    "number": 23,
    "street": "Dream Road"
  }
}





Databases & Shared Responsibility on AWS
 > AWS offers use to manage different databases
 > Benefits include:
	- Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
	- Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades
	- Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
	- Monitoring, Alerting are integrated
 > AWS handles all of the management related to database, all you need to worry is how you will store the data
 
NOTE:
1. We can also run database technologies inside EC2 instance. But you must handle everything by yourself like resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault tolerance, scaling etc.
