50 EBS Overview


EBS Volume
 > stands for Elastic Block Store
 > EBS Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
 > it allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
 > they can only be mounted to ONE INSTANCE at a time (at the CCP level)
 > they are BOUND to a specific availability zone
 > ANALOGY: Similar to a "network USB stick" or an "NFS/Network File System"
 > FREE TIER: 30GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month
 


EBS Volume deep dive
 > its a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
	- it uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
	- it can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
	- can be attached ON DEMAND
 > it is locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
	- An EBS Volume in us-east-1a CANNOT be attached to us-east-1b
	- To move a volume across, you first need to SNAPSHOT it
 > when creating EBS, you need to have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, or IO operations per second)
	- you will get billed for all the provisioned capacity
	- you can increase the capacity of the drive over time



EBS Volume Example
US-EAST-1A
EC2 A
 > EBS 1
EC2 B
 > EBS 2
 > EBS 3

US-EAST-1B
EC2 C
 > EBS 4
EBS 5 (unattached)





EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
 > in EC2 instance, we can specify a "Delete on Termination" attribute to all Volumes attached to the EC2 instance
 > "Delete on Termination" attribute determines if the attached Volume will be deleted if the EC2 instance is terminated
 > by default, an EC2 Instance will:
	- have a "Root" Volume attached to it and its set to be deleted on termination
	- any another EBS volumes attached to it will have the "Delete on Termination" set to false
