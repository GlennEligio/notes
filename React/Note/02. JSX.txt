02. JSX


JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
	> similar to HTML but just a syntactic sugar for JavaScript
	> similar to HTML syntax aside from the few things
		- some HTML parameter have different names (class -> className, for -> htmlFor) since they conflict with JS keywords
	> we can inject Javascript expressions in the JSX using curly braces {}
		- these JS expressions include
			1. JS variables			{name }
			2. JS ternary operations	{x ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
			3. JS operations 		{1+2}
		- in example below, we injected the "name" variable to JSX expression that we return

EX:
function App() {
  const name = "Brad";

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello from React</h1>
      <h2>Hello {name}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
