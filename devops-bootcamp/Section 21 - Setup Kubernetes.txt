Section 21 - Setup Kubernetes

119. Kubernetes Setup - Introduction and Minikube

Setup Kubernetes
1. Locally hosted or on-premise
	> Minikube and MicroK8s
		- solutions for developers or those who want to play around and learn Kubernetes
	> Kubeadm
		- used to bootstrap and manage production grade Kubernetes clusters
2. Cloud hosted
	> GCP, AWS, Azure
3. Lab hosted
	> provided by KodeKloud
	> we can access right on our browser


Minikube
 > with Minikube, all of the components are BUNDLED into a single image, providing us a pre-configured SINGLE NODE Kubernetes cluster so we can get started in a matter of minute
 > minikube provides an executable command line utility that will automatically download the ISO and deploy it in a virtualization platform such as Oracle, VirtualBox, or VMWare Fusio
	- this means that we must have a HYPERVISION installed on our system
	
Kubectl
 > kubectl is a CLI tool that we must install
 > using this CLI tool, we can interact with the K8s cluster






120. Demo - Minikube-Setup


Steps
1. Install kubectl
2. Install minikube
3. Enable Virtualization in the BIOS
4. Start minikube
5. Check minikube status
6. Use kubectl to interact with k8s cluster
	> get nodes
	> deploy 'echoserver' docker image as deployment
		- this will show the status of k8s cluster
	> configure service to expose echoserver
	> access echoserver service using the service

NOTES:
1. kubectl CLI tool must be installed before we install minikube

If the minikube installation has been done on the macOS, then to access the URL on the local browser, we need to do a few steps to get the service URL to work. Those steps are covered on this documentation page: –
