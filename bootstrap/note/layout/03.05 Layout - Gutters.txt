03.05 Layout - Gutters

Gutters
	> Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space and align content in the Bootstrap grid system.
	> Gutters are the GAPS between column content, created by horizontal padding. We set padding-right and padding-left on each column, and use negative margin to offset that at the start and end of each row to align content.
	> Gutters start at 1.5rem (24px) wide. This allows us to match our grid to the padding and margin spacers scale.
	> Gutters can be responsively adjusted. Use breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify horizontal gutters, vertical gutters, and all gutters.

Notation/Syntax
{property}{side}-{size}

g-{size}	for all sides
gx-{size}	for x-axis gutter
gy-{size}	for y-axis gutter

Horizontal Gutter 
	> defines the space between the col elements and the sides of the row
	> higher the size, the LESSER the gap between col elements and the sides of the row
	> SYNTAX:
		gx-{size}	for left and right
	> NOTE: If larger gutters are used, it may cause unwanted OVERFLOW. For this, we can either
		a. Use matching padding utility for Container
		b. Add "overflow-hidden" class to Container


Vertical Gutter
	> defines the space between the col elements of a row
		-> this happens when a row can occupy all the col due to overflow (col elements occupy > 12 columns)
	> higher the size, the LARGER the gap between the wrapped col elements in a row
	> SYNTAX
		gy-{size}	for y-axis
	> NOTE: If larger gutters are used, it may cause unwanted OVERFLOW. For this, we can either
		a. Use matching padding utility for Container
			-> py-{size}
		b. Add "overflow-hidden" class to Container
