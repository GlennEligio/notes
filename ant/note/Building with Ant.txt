Comparing 3 Java build tools (Ant vs Maven vs Gradle)


Ant
 > needs to have a build.xml file
	- build.xml contains the project definition 

build.xml
 > contains the following components
	1. project definition properties
	2. target(s), which defines the command that will be executed in order build the project
 > these target(s) can be executed sequentially by defining its dependencies through "depend" property
	- based on the targets and their "depends" prop, the ANT will execute these targets in specific order
	- ex: if target "build" depends on target "clean", "clean" will be executed FIRST before "build"

NOTE:
1. Apache ANT doesnt have feature to manage libraries and dependencies
	> for this, we use third party tools like Ivy

Building with Ant
1. In the root directory of project (where build.xml is located), execute "ant ivy"
	> this is to install Ivy in the ant directory
	> if you use other libraries and dependency management tool, you will use different command (ant <toolname>)
2. Execute "ant resolve" to execute all the target inside the build.xml
	> this will use the Ivy to resolve/download the dependencies needed in the project
3. Execute "ant"
	> this will use the build.xml in order to finalize the build
