Characteristics
1. Monolithic apps
	> typically in On Prem Data Centers, it tends to have Monolithic apps
2. Designed for predictable scalability
	> with On Prem, you will need to have an application that can handle predictable scalability
	> they would assume that there will be certain amount of scalability needed, and they try to predict it and build the app based on it
	> anything beyond that, they will find a way of handling traffic by not serving, but by trying to keep the application running
	> application in this case are built to handle predictable amount of scalability
3. Relational database
	> On Prem data center typically have a "monolithic" database
	> RDBMS are typically monolith, running in one server, to serve as one source of truth
	> If you have one monolithic app, it is more logical to also have one monolithic database to handle its data related logic
4. Synchronized processing
	> this means that we can easily predict the order of the operation or the sequence of the processes
	> ex: for e-commerce, these happens;
		- user used card, app validates the card
		- service makes a charge
		- charge returns successfully
		- user place an order
		- order returns successfully
		- service returns an order invoice
		- service sends email of the invoice
5. Design to avoid failures (MTBF)
	> design to make the MTBF as large as possible
	> MTBF refers to "Mean Time Between Failure"
		- refers to the mean value of all the duration between all failure instances
6. Occasional large updates
	> updates are done in batches and in longer frequency (monthly, bi-monthly, etc)
	> these updates are typically large in size
7. Manual management
	> hardware and the deployment would be management manually, typically have separate person or team to do this
8. Snowflake servers
	> this refers to the servers that are very unique
	> they have certain characteristic that are necessary for the application to work
	> this typically causes the migration of the services to another server some problem since they need to replicate these snowflake servers to make sure the apps inside it runs correctly
