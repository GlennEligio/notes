008 Designer vs Developer


Designer
 > focused on the aesthetics, experience of the user

Developer
 > focused more on the internals, and the things that make the product work

Project phases
1. Planning phase
	> most important phase
	> we will mostly talk to the client what their needs are, and plan according to that
2. Design phase
	> all about using the information in the planning phase and making it into reality
	> examples are site structure, mobile structure, visual representation that users sees
3. Development phase
	> where we do the programming work
	> we take all the assets and information that we gathered from the previous phase (Design phase) and try to implement it on a live website, or a live mobile app
	> typically uses html css and javascript to make the designs come alive
4. Launch phase
	> this is where we deliver our product to the users, to the public
	> we might do some tweaks, or some testing of our site to make sure that it works properly
5. Post launch phase
	> this is where we handoff the product to the client
	> we will also monitor the launch of the product, how the users use the product, or if any issues are encountered


NOTES:
1. Project phases runs in loop
	> all issues encountered in post launch will be logged to be used for planning phase again
2. We will "never" be finished in our product
	> we can always improve the product based on feedbacks
3. Designer is in charge with planning, design, and post-launch phases
4. Developers is in charge with development, launch, and post-launch phases
