08. React

includes:
React
Import and Export
Parts of React.Components
	1. State
	2. Props
	3. Events



React
	> used to create application
	> created by facebook
	> SINGLE PAGE WEBAPP


Installation


React Folder Structure
1. App folder name
	> defined when use command create-react-app <app-name>

Inside App folder name
1. node_modules
	> contains all node modules
2. public
	> contains all static files used to create the single page React app
		1. index.html
			= contains the webpages to show (hence single page application)
		2. logo images
		3. manifest.json
			= contains app packages information, all react modules, project configurations, etc
3. src
	> source folder


React can be written:
1. with JSX - Javascrip XML
2. without JSX


Methods of including HTML element in 


Features in React
1. HTML and JS injection using JSX
	> we can inject HTML elements as values of variables in React JS using JSX
	> we can also inject JS inside HTML elements

ex:
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;


Two ways of importing/including HTML elements in a JavaScript
1. Import function that returns html elements
2. Import a Class that extends React.Component
	- class must override the render() from React.Component
	- render() must return HTML elements

1. Imporing function that returns html elements
	> the function must
		- start with UPPERCASE letter
		- must return HTML elements
			= the HTML element to return must only have ONE parent element
EX:
export default function ProductList() {
    return <div>
        <h1>This is Product List functional component</h1>
    </div>
}


2. Importing React.Component class

React.Component
	> class of React Framework
	> used to contain html elements to render	
	> have method to override called render();
	> classes that extends to React.Component 
		- must IMPORT the React from 'react' npm
		- must OVERRIDE the render();
		- must start with UPPERCASE letter

render()
	> method of React.Component class
	> must return an HTML element to display


Syntax:
CREATING A React.Component
import React from 'react';

class ExampleClass extends React.Component {

	// logic, typically constructing the element to display
	const element = <h1>Element</h1>

	render(){
		return element;
	}
}


TWO WAYS OF EXPORTING A React.Component
1. Add export keyword in the Class
EX:
import React from 'react';

export default class ExampleClass extends React.Component {

	// logic, typically constructing the element to display
	const element = <h1>Element</h1>

	render(){
		return element;
	}
}

2. Create an export function to return the Class itself

import React from 'react';

class ExampleClass extends React.Component {

	// logic, typically constructing the element to display
	const element = <h1>Element</h1>

	render(){
		return element;
	}
}

export ExampleClass;




Importing JavaScript Class/Function
	> use import keyword at the import section
SYNTAX:
import ClassName from "jsfilepath";

EX:
import AddUpload from "./AddUpload";




State, Props, and Events
	> these three are typically added in a React.Component
	> these three represents the Properies/Behavior/State of a React.Component

State
	> refers to the state of the React.Component
	> you can modify or change the State of React.Component using Events
	> to add State in Class<?> extends React.Component class, add it as properties of the Class itself
		- typically done in the constructor() function

Event
	> refers to the event that will happen in the React.Component Class
	> Events are functions inside the Class, and is called in one of the HTML element events (onClick, onHover, onFocus, etc)
	> to add Event in React.Component Class, add functions inside the Class by
		- defining Anonymous Function inside the Class
		- adding a function inside and setting it as Property of the Class itself

Props
	> defines the properties of the React.Component or Function that returns HTML elements
	> this is how we will pass the Data that we will display in an element
		- ex: Data used to fill up the Product Element 
	>  Like HTML attributes for React.Component

SYNTAX:
<ClassFunction prop1=value1, prop2=value2>

EX:
import AddUpload from "./AddUpload";

INSIDE JS file
<AddUpload itemToUpload=item>




PASSING PROPERTIES AND FETCHING PROPERTIES of React.Component and Functions
	> to access the properties we passed into a Function or React.Component, we will need to
		1. add "props" parameter to the Function or React.Component's constructor function

ex:
export default class Main extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {

or 

export default function Product(props)


		2. from "props" parameter, fetch the attributes we passed when we used the imported React.Component or function

ex:
Import usage
<UserList users={this.state.users} />
		
function property fetching	
            {props.users.map((user, index) => (
              <User key={index} user={user} />
            ))}
