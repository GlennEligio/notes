37 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Diagnose and Correct File Permission Problems

ACL
 > stands for Access Control Lists
 > ACL (Access Control Lists) are the more granular option for file and directory permissions. 
 > It allows multiple groups or users to have varying access.
 > when a file is have extended permission, it will have the plus sign at the end of permission output of "ls -l"
	ex: -rw-rwxr--+ 1 jglenn jglenn     0 Sep 20 16:12 file2.txt
 > with ACL, we can get and set the extended permissions using two commands
	- getfacl
	- setfacl


Commands
getfacl
 > get file access control list
 > provides informations like filename, owner, group, and the list of extended permissions to specific user, groups, others, etc
 > sypnosis:
	$ getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] file ...
	$ getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] -
 > ex:
	$ getfacl file2.txt

OUTPUT of getfacl file2.txt
# file: file2.txt
# owner: jglenn
# group: jglenn
user::rw-
user:user1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--


setfacl 
 > set file access control list
 > sypnosis:
	$ setfacl [-bkndRLPvh] [{-m|-x} acl_spec] [{-M|-X} acl_file] file ...
	$ setfacl --restore=file
 > ex:
	setfacl -m u:user1:rwx file2.txt
		- add an extended permission to file2.txt where the user "user1" have rwx permission
	setfacl -m g:accounts:rwx file2.txt
		- add an extended permission to file2.txt where the group "accounts" have rwx permission
