120 AWS Batch Overview

AWS Batch
 > fully managed batch processing at any scale
 > Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
 > A "batch" job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous)
 > Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot instances
 > AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute/memory
 > You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
 > Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
 > Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure




AWS Batch - Simplified Example

Amazon S3 (Contains Objects)

AWS Batch 
 > Runs ECS, which contains EC2 instance and/or Spot Instance
 > Processes the Object

Batch vs Lambda
Lambda:
 > time limit (max 15 minutes)
 > limited runtimes (few programming language)
 > limited temporary disk space
 > Serverless

Batch
 > No time limit
 > Any runtime as long as its packaged as a Docker image
 > Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space
 > Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS, so no need to think of auto scaling)



NOTE:
1. Anything that can run in ECS can run in Batch jobs
