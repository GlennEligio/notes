47 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Configure network services to start automatically at boot


Configure network services to start automatically at boot
 > we have three ways to make network services or connections start automatically on boot
 > For Network Service, we can
	1. use "systemctl enable SERVICE" to run the network services on boot
		- example of network service is the "httpd" module
 > For Network Connections, we can do either of the two
	2. set the ONBOOT property to yes of the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/(NIC) config file
	3. execute "nmcli connection modify CONNECTION connection.autoconnect yes" command
	


Commands
systemctl {enable, disable} SERVICE
 > used to enable or disable a service to be run on boot
 > ex:
	$ systemctl enable httpd


nmcli connection modify CONNECTION connection.autoconnect [yes | no]
 > configure the network connection so that it autoconnects on boot
 > ex:
	$ nmcli connection modify eht0 connection.autoconnect yes
