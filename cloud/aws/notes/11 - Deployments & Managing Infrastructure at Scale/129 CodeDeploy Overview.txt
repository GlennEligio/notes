AWS CodeDeploy
 > We want to deploy our application automatically
 > Works with EC2 Instances (Cloud)
 > Works with On-Premises Servers
 > Hybrid service (since it works in both Cloud and On-premises)
 > Servers/Instances must be provisioned and configured AHEAD of time with CodeDeploy Agent



EX:
EC2 Instance

v1 -> v2
v1 -> v2
v1 -> v2


On-premises
