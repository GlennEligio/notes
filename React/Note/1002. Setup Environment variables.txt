SOURCE: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61461142/how-can-i-configure-my-prod-env-vars-when-i-run-my-build-process

NOTE:
1. Only works with React app that is bootstrapped using create-react-app
2. Can only create these at build phase


Creating Environment variable
1. Create a file named .env
2. Inside, create a key=value pairs
	> they must be separated by LINEBREAKS only
	> must start with REACT_APP_VARIABLENAME

EX:
REACT_APP_GATEWAY_URI=http://gateway
REACT_APP_PORT=9001


Accessing the Environment variable in JS file
1. Use process.env object
	> this Object contains all Environment variables
	> by default, it contains NODE_ENV variable

Ex:
const gatewayUri = process.env.REACT_APP_GATEWAY_URI
