21. Creating Environment Variables to enable Microservice Communication



Adding Environment variable in Pods' Containers
1. Add "env" property in Container where we want to add env var
	- this env property can take an Array of name and value properties
2. Add the name and value property in the Array to assign as environment variables of Container

EX:
Below, we can see in .spec.template.spec.containers, in the first Container, we added an Environment variable CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_URI with value of "http://currency-exchange" which points to the currency-exchange service

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "1"
  labels:
    app: currency-conversion
  name: currency-conversion
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 2
  revisionHistoryLimit: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: currency-conversion
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: currency-conversion
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: shuntjg/mmv2-currency-conversion-service:0.0.12-SNAPSHOT
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: mmv2-currency-conversion-service
        env:
          - name: CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_URI
            value: http://currency-exchange
      restartPolicy: Always
