15. Docker Compose

Docker Compose
	> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
	> With Compose, you will use a YAML file to configure your application's service
	> Then, with a single command, you can create and start all the services from your configuration


Using Compose is basically a three-step process
1. Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere
2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment
3. Run "docker-compose up" and Compose starts and runs the entire app



Installing Docker compose file
1. Fetch Docker compose and place it in "/usr/local/bin/docker-compose"
	sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
2. Have the docker-compose be executable
	chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
3. Check docker-compose version
	docker-compose --version



Contents of docker-compose yaml files

versions:
	> defines the version of this Compose object
services:	
	> defines the services to run
	> these services refers to the Containers to run
	> and these containers can have properties similar to a Docker Container like
		depends_on:
			> defines the service that MUST BE RUNNING before this Service can run
		image: 
			> defines the docker image to use
		volumes:
			> refers to the docker volume to use
		environment:
			> refers to the environment variables
		ports:
			> refers to the PORT MAPPING to use
volumes:
	> refers to the Docker Volumes to create


EX:
version: '3.3'

services:
   db:
     image: mysql:5.7
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:latest
     ports:
       - "8000:80"
     restart: always
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
volumes:
    db_data: {}
		


Commands for Docker compose
docker-compose up [options] [--scale SERVICE=NUM...] [SERVICE...]
	> runs a docker-compose.yaml file
	> there must be a docker-compose.yaml file in the current directory
	> "-d" makes the services/container run in dettach mode
	> we can also specify the Service that we only want to run in the Docker compose
	> we can also specify the scale/replica of a specific Service inside Docker Compose

docker-compose scale [SERVICE=NUM...]
docker-compose --scale [SERVICE=NUM...]
	> used for scaling a specific Service in the Compose
