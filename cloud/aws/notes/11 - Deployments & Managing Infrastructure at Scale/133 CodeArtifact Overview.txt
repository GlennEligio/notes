133 CodeArtifact Overview

AWS CodeArtifact
 > Software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies), and new ones are created
 > Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
 > Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
 > CodeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management for software development
 > Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pipe, and NuGet
 > Developers and CodeBuilt can then retrieve depdencies straight from CodeArtifact
