19 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Adjust process scheduling

Scheduler
 > built into the Kernel
 > decides which runnable processes will be executed by the CPU next
 > offers scheduling policies
	SCHED_FIFO 	= first in, first out, real-time processes	
	SCHED_RR		= round robin real-time processes
	SCHED_OTHER	= normal sharing, default
	SCHED_BATCH	= almost the same as SCHED_OTHER, but the process is considered always the most CPU consuming

NOTE:
1. Be cautious when it comes to changing scheduling policies and priorities of the applications


Commands
chrt [option] -p [priority] pid
chrt [options] priority command [arg...]
 > can be used for scheduling policy related task like
	- checking scheduling policy of an application
	- checking the list of scheduling policies and the max number of priority we can assign
 > options:
	-p PID	checks the scheduling policy and priority of the process with specified PID
	-m		checks the scheduling policy and range of priority number we can assign
	-o		set scheduling policy to SCHED_OTHER
	-f		set scheduling policy to SCHED_FIFO
	-r		set to SCHED_RR, will be the default value
	-b		set to SCHED_BATCH
	-i 		set to SCHED_IDLE
	-d		set to SCHED_DEADLINE
 > ex:
	$ chrt -p 2577
		- list the process with PID 2577's scheduling process and priority
	$ chrt -m
	$ chrt -b -p 0 2577	
		- sets process with PID 2577 to SCHED_BATCH with priority of 0
	$ chrt -f -p 50 2577
		- sets process with PID 2577 to SCHED_FIFO with priority of 50
