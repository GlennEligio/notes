~~~~~ COMPONENT - MODALS ~~~~~
Modals
	> we can create modals using Bootstrap class
	> for functionality (open/close), we can use the data api
	> by default, modal closes when user click outside the modal

Creating Modal
1. Create div for wrapping entire modal
	-> .modal class
	-> tabindex of -1
2. Create div inside the div.modal for wrapping the modal dialog
	-> .modal-dialog class
3. Create another div inside the div.modal-dialog
	-> .modal-content class
4. Inside the .modal-content div, we can create three div
	-> 1st div for modal header
	-> 2nd div for modal body
	-> 3rd div for modal footer
5. For modal header div
	-> .modal-header class
	-> inside, we can define the modal title and a close button
		=> modal title will have .modal-title class
		=> button can have .btn-close for predefined close button style
6. For modal body, we can modify it whenever we want
7. For modal footer, we can add some buttons
	-> these buttons can also be used to close the modal


Adding Opening/Closing functionality
1. Create a button to open the modal
	-> data-bs-toggle="modal"
	-> data-bs-target="#{modal-id}" must MATCH the id value of the .modal element
		=> ex: if .modal element have id="modalEx1", then data-bs-target="#modalEx1"
2. Add attributes to the buttons inside Modal to be used for closing it
	-> data-bs-dismiss="modal"



Static backdrop
	> with this, User will be able to close the modal ONLY by using buttons inside modal with 'data-bs-dismiss="modal"'
	> to do this, we will need to add data-bs-backdrop="static" and data-bs-keyboard="false"

data-bs-backdrop="static"
	> prevent user from closing modal by touching outside it
data-bs-keyboard="false"
	> prevent user from closing modal by using ESC key in keyboard



Scrollable Modal
	> to make modal scrollable, add .modal-dialog-scrollable class in CONJUNCTION to .modal element
	
<!-- Scrollable modal -->
<div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable">




Vertically Centered Modal
	> to make modal vertically centered, add .modal-dialog-centered in CONJUNCITON to .modal element

<!-- Vertically centered modal -->
<div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-centered">



Adding fade effect to Modal
	> to add fade effect, we can use .fade class ALONGSIDE .modal element
		=> <div class="modal fade">
