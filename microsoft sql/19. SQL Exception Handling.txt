EXCEPTION HANDLING

THROW 
	> this clause is used to raise an exception and transfers the execution to a CATCH block of a TRY....CATCH construct
	> ErrorNumber must be between 50000 to 2147483647

SYNTAX:

	THROW [ { ErrorNumber | @localvariable },
		{ Message | @localvariable },

	BEGIN TRY
		{ SQLStatement | StatementBlock }
	END TRY
	BEGIN CATCH
		[ {SQLStatement | StatementBlock} ]
	END CATCH
