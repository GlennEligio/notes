Font-related CSS properties

Font size
	> defines the size of the text


Font family
	> defines the set of font style that the browser will use
	> it first look at the font style at 1st index and iterates through all of them until it found the style that is available 
	> pre-defined font-family values available in VS Code are the ones that look the same
	> 1st font style will be a specific and the last will be the generic style
	> the further the list, the more chances that it is available in most of browser

EX:
h1{
	font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace
}


Font-weight
	> defines the "thickness" of the characters of text
	> comes from putting "weight" in each stroke where in heavier the stroke, the thicker the line
	> can have multiple values, which includes
		- in range of (100-900) with increment of 100 (100,200,300,...,900)
		- bold, bolder
		- lighter
		- normal
		- inherit
		- initial
	> the final font-weight of the text will STILL DEPEND on the available variants of the font itself
		EX: if we only have Roboto 400 and 700 and we have two h3 with font-weight of 700 and 900. They will have BOTH 700 as font-weight since only 700 is the available




Font-style
	> property that specifies the font style for a text.
	> there are several values that can be passed in font-style
		a. normal 	- normal version of the text
				- default value
		b. italic	- style where the character is slanted by 8-12 degrees
		c. oblique	- normal but slanted version
				- if either italic or oblique is not available, the CSS will use the other one

Fetching a font-family in the Google Font
1. Click the first font that you want to use
2. In the Font style's webpage, select the styles of Font you want to add
	EX: In Roboto, we can choose Thin 100 and Light 300
3. When selected, they will be added in the "Selected family" section
4. To see the Selected family section, press the icon at top right with 4square and plus icon


Adding the Font family from Google Font to Webpage
1. To add the Font-family in Webpage project, we can either
	a. use <link> in the <head> tags
	b. use @import inside <style> tags

EX: 
<link> method

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;1,100&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

@import method
<style>
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;1,100&display=swap');
</style>


2. To use the font-family in CSS rules, specify the Font style we used and the generic font style it is based on
	> format will be

		font-family: 'FontStyle', genericFontBase

EX:
	Roboto is based on san-serif. For us to use them in CSS rule, we will use

		font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif
