Infrastructure
 > this section allows us to monitor the main location from where searches are performed
 > the farther the group of user is to the server, the more latency will occur, increasing the response time of our search queries
	- to solve this, we can use DSN or Distributed Search Network
 > this tab contains the following panels
	1. DSN - Distributed Search Network
		- with DSN, it will replicate all of our data our index to different data centers around the globe, making the latency for each uses low
