02. Apply CSS Stylesheets to Thymeleaf Templates


TWO OPTIONS OF CSS file to use
1. Local CSS files as part of your project
2. Referencing remote CSS files


Static resources location
	> Spring Boot will look for static resources in
		src/main/resources/static
	> inside static folder, there can be sub directories for specific files like
		static/css
		static/images
		static/js
		etc... 
	> Spring Boot will also search the following directories for static resources beside /src/main/resources
		/META-INF/resources
		/resources
		/static
		/public
	> the search order will be top-down fashion



3RD Party CSS libraries
	> to use 3rd party CSS Libraries (like Bootstrap), we can either
		1. Local Installation
			- download Bootstrap file(s) and add to /static/css directory
		2. Remote files
			- create <link> element inside <head>
			- define rel property of <link> to "stylesheet"
			- define href property to the actual link of css file


Reference CSS in Thymeleaf template
	> to reference CSS file, 
		1. add a <link> element inside <head>
		2. define rel attribute and pass "stylesheet"
		3. define th:href and pass "@{css-file-location-in-static-folder}"
			- ex: "@{/css/demo.css}"

@ symbol
	> reference context path of your application (app root)
		- the static folder of src/main/resources
