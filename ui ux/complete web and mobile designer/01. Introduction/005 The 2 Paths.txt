TWO PATHS
1. Follow along
	> follow along the course, from 
		- sketching
		- having ideas
		- having final full pledge interactions
		- animations
		- final designs for the product
2. I have a product
	> you can use the steps/knowledge learned from this course to apply it to your own design system


NOTES:
1. The course is focused on showing you the steps a designer would take from the very beginning to the end
	> by following until the end, you can implement this in order to create your own design system
