Day 4


Defining a Reference Type

Creating a Constructor function
	> function used to create Javascript Objects
	> similar to creating a Constructor to a Java Object
		- contains Constructor and method
	> have the following syntax
	> parameter and parenthesis is OPTIONAL if Constructor function DOES NOT have parameters

SYNTAX:
function Object(prop1, prop2){
	// properties
	this.prop1 = prop1; 
	this.prop2 = prop2;
	var prop3; // private property, can only be accessed using getter

	// some method
	this.method = function(){
	
	}

	// getter
	this.getProp3 = function(){
		return prop3;
	}
	
	// setter
	this.setProp1 = function(argProp1) {
		this.prop1 = argProp1;
	}
}

EX:
function Employee(id, name){
	this.id = id;
	this.name = name;
	this.work = function(){
		console.log("I am working");
	}
}



"delete" keyword
	> We can delete an Javascript object's property by using "delete" keyword
SYNTAX:
delete Object.propName

EX:
delete family.sister // this will delete the sister property to the family Object




"in" keyword
	> We can check if property exist in an Object by using "in" keyword
	> returns a boolean value (true or false)
SYNTAX:
propName in Object

EX:
son in family // returns false



for in loop	
	> use to iterate properties of an Object
	
SYNTAX:
for (tempProp in Object){
	// logic
}

	> where tempProp is a placeholder for each property to use

EX:
for (people in family){
	// will write each property of family in console
	console.log(people)
}



prototype
	> used to add a new property in an existing object

SYNTAX:
Object.property.name = value

EX:
var



PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE
	> we can either user
		1. Object.create()
			= we will pass the Javascript object we want to use as value
		2. __proto__
			= we will call this method is the Javascript object we passed as value

EX:
var person = {
	name: "John",
	email: "jg@gmail.com"
}
var john1 = person.__proto__;
var john2 = new Object.create(person);





NOTE: 
1. In Javascript, everything is an object. 
	> object have method, properties, and constructor function to create it

EX:
var name = "Harsh"
// or
var name = new String("Harsh") // same output as above


2. If Constructor method doesn't have any argument, parenthesis is OPTIONAL

Ex:
var name = new String();
// or
var name = new String;



3. We can ADD properties to a Javascript object by defining the new property

EX:
var family = new Object();
family.father = "a";
family.mother = "b";
family.sister = "c";
family.brother = "d";
console.log(family);



4. Assign Javascript object to a variable as value have pass-by-reference behavior
	> if we dont assign the Javascript object to a variable as NEW INSTANCE, it will do a pass-by-reference

Ex:
var family = {
	father:"a",
	mother:"b"
} 
var newFamily = family; // object value passed as reference
newFamily.son = "c";
console.log(newFamily); // will have son as property
console.log(family);	// will also have son as property






STRICT EQUAL OPERAND (===)
	> same as EQUAL operand (==), but it also checks the data type of the values it compares

EX:
var x = 2;
var y = '2';



prompt, alert, and confirm
	> used to display pop-up in browser to do something

confirm
	> give a yes or no prompt to user
	> constructor function takes a String object as argument
		- this will be the display message for the pop-up window
	> returns a boolean value based on what button user used

prompt
	> give a textbox for user to enter information
	> constructor function takes a String object as argument
		- this wil be the display message for the pop-up window
	> returns the value entered by the user in textbox

alert
	> gives a display alert to the user with a message and OK button
	> constructor function takes a String object as parameter
		- this will be the display message for the pop-up window	
	> returns nothing



VARIABLE SCOPES
1. global
	> variables that can be used or references throughout the Javascript file
	> to create global variable
		- create variable at root level of Javascript file
		- create variable WITHOUT KEYWORDS inside a function

2. local
	> variable that can be used in a specific scope (e.g. inside a function)
		- access local variable outside of their scope will give out an error
	> to create local variable
		- create variable inside function WITH KEYWORD (var or let)



ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS
	> functions which do NOT have any names
	> function that are SELF INVOKING
		- means they automatically call themselves
	> we use these functions for initialization purpose
		- similar static {} of Java
	> does not return a value

SYNTAX:
(function (param1, param2) {
	// logic	
}) (arg1, arg2)

where
param1, param2 are parameters of anonymous function
arg1, arg2 are arguments to be passed in the function




JSON (Javascript Object Notation)
Creating a JSON
	> create a JSON using the syntax below will still be considered as Javascript Object
		- will have same value as if we didnt used double quotes to the properties name

SYNTAX:
var name = {
	"prop1":"value",
	"prop2":"value",
	"prop3":"value"
}


JSON.stringify(Object o)
	> converts a Javascript object into a JSON string


JSON.parse(String s)
	> converts a String input into a Javascript object




~~~~~ ECMAScript ~~~~~~~
1. Arrow function expression
	> An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.
	> Anonymous to the lambda functions in other languages
	> For the Arrow function to be used as alternative to a traditional function expression, the function to be replaced must be an ANONYMOUS FUNCTION

EX:
// function to determine if 1st param is greater than 2nd para
function (x,y)
	return x > y;
}; 

// arrow function expression
(x,y) => x > y;

// function to display message to console
function (name) {
	console.log(name)
}
// as arrow function
(name) => console.log(name)


USAGE:
var add = (x,y) => x+y;
console.log(add(2,4));


2. Function.prototype.bind()
	> The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its "this" keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
	> if we dont call



3. setTimeout()
	> The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.




4. let
	> keyword used to declare variable
	> these variables have
		a. block level scroping
		b. not available outside block it is contained
	> used typically for
		a. local variables
		b. for loop for declaring iterator value

EX:
for(let i=0; i>10; i++){
	console.log(i);
}


5. const
	> keywords used to create CONSTANT variables
	> constant variable are IMMUTABLE which means we can NOT REDECLARE the variable
	> constant variable's properties CAN STILL BE CHANGED

EX:
var family = {
	
}
