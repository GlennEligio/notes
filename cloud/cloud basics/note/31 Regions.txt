Data Centers
 > physical location that houses hardware infrastructure
 > typically behind one network, with firewall added to secure it
	- companies manages the internal network of these data centers
 > most small companies used to have one on-prem
 > Companies typically have a backup data center (DR)
	- DR refers to Disaster Recovery data
 

Cloud
 > Data centers are ABSTRACTED out by design
 > Cloud providers exposes this Data centers to you as "Regions"



Regions
 > in Cloud context, a Region refers to a bunch of Data centers in a specific geographical location
 > these Regions are distributed around the world
 > usually, the Regions are the context of all operations
	- we can think of the Region as the higher level node under which all of the resources are created
 > Cloud Providers gives the consumers/users an option to which Region they want the resources to be created (ex: Singapore, US East, US West, Japan, etc)



Choosing a Region
1. Cost
	> same amount of resources may have different cost based on the region (ex: EC2 with same config can cost differ)
2. User locations
	> you want to choose a Region that is closest to you consumers. Reason is that your users may face network delays if your application is hosted on a server that is far from them
3. Available services
	> not all services are available in all regions
	> this depends on the hardware that is available in that region
	> ex: no Hypervisor hardware in a particular region
4. SLAs
	> different regions have their own SLAs
	> choose Region who's SLA is okay to you
5. Data Compliance
	> applies only to specific company
 	> each region have their own data compliance and regulation
	> ex: US citizen health info cant go outside US
