05. EcmaScript5 (ES5)


~~~~~ ECMAScript ~~~~~~~
1. Arrow function expression
	> An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.
	> Anonymous to the lambda functions in other languages
	> For the Arrow function to be used as alternative to a traditional function expression, the function to be replaced must be an ANONYMOUS FUNCTION

EX:
// function to determine if 1st param is greater than 2nd para
function (x,y)
	return x > y;
}; 

// arrow function expression
(x,y) => x > y;

// function to display message to console
function (name) {
	console.log(name)
}
// as arrow function
(name) => console.log(name)


USAGE:
var add = (x,y) => x+y;
console.log(add(2,4));


2. Function.prototype.bind()
	> The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its "this" keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
	> if we dont call



3. setTimeout()
	> The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.




4. let
	> keyword used to declare variable
	> these variables have
		a. block level scroping
		b. not available outside block it is contained
	> used typically for
		a. local variables
		b. for loop for declaring iterator value

EX:
for(let i=0; i>10; i++){
	console.log(i);
}


5. const
	> keywords used to create CONSTANT variables
	> constant variable are IMMUTABLE which means we can NOT REDECLARE the variable
	> constant variable's properties CAN STILL BE CHANGED

EX:
var family = {
	
}
