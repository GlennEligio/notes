3. Accented tables
	> Striped rows
		- "table-striped"
		- will apply alternating alpha of color to table rows
		- applicable with table variants
			-> ex: <table class="table-primary table table-striped">
	> Hoverable rows
		- "table-hover"
		- makes the table so that when we hover in a row, it will change color
	> Active tables/row/cell
		- "table-active"
		- applied in table rows and table cell
		- makes it look like it is active (darker)


4. Table borders
	> Bordered tables
		- "table-bordered"
		- applicable in table
		- can be used together with border color utilities
			-> ex: <table class="table table-bordered border-primary">
	> Tables without borders
		- "table-borderless"
		- removes the borders of the table, rows, and cells


5. Small table
	> "table-sm"
	> applied in table
	> makes table more COMPACT by cutting all cell padding in HALF


6. Vertical alignment
	> here, we will use the vertical alignment utility classes of Bootstrap (ex: .align-center, .align-top, .align-bottom)
		-> applied in table, tr, or td elements
	> table cells in thead element is always vertically aligned in BOTTOM
	> table cells in tbody element INHERITS their alignment from table element and aligned to the TOP by default


7. Nesting
	> KEY NOTE: Border styles, active styles, and table variants are NOT inherited by nested tables.


8. Anatomy
	> Table head
		- we can use .table-light, .table-dark, or any variant to emphasis the thead
	> Table foot
	> Captions
		- we can use caption element to serve as "heading" for a table
		- help users with screen readers to find a table and understand what it is about and decide if they want to to read it


9. Responsive tables
	> Always responsive
		- by making the tables responsive, it allows the tables to be scrolled HORIZONTALLY with ease
		- we can also apply breakpoints to define when it will be responsive
	> Breakpoint specific

NOTATION
.table-responsive
	> will be responsive in ANY screen
.table-responsive-{breakpoint}
	> will be responsive when above the specified breakpoint
	> ex: .table-responsive-xl will be responsive over xl breakpoint
