06 Working with the on prem model


Steps on build Data Center
 > Company hires infrastructure engineers
 > Sets up one or more data centers
	- includes buying real estate where we will build the datacenters
 > Estimates the capacity needed to build data centers
 	- includes hardware
	- TRICKIEST PART, since we will need to do some guessing to know how much resources we needed
 > Procure the hardware needed
 > Setup hardware on data center
	- put machines on rack, and setup cabling
 > Setup deployment process
	- add software and network security setup


Estimating Data Center capacity
 > in estimating capacity, we typically plan for the peak
 > Peak refers to the maximum usage/traffic being loaded in the Data Center
	- this typically happen during peak hours where many users use the services at the same time



Typical Data Center
1. Contains farms of servers
2. The data center can easily handle typical loads
3. There will be an occasional peak handling
	- the data center performance will depend on how much capacity it is designed to handle



Problem with Data Center
1. Hardware idle times
	> since the data center is designed around peak handling, and the peak only happens occasionally, the hardware sits idly in normal occasion
