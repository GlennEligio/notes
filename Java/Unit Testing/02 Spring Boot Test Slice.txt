Spring Boot Test Slices

1. @WebMvcTest
	> used for testing Spring MVC parts of application
	> included in the Spring Test Context
		@Controller, @RestController, @ControllerAdvice, @JsonComponent, Converter, Filter, WebMvcConfigurer
	> does NOT INCLUDE
		@Service, @Component, @Repository beans
	> provide great support for endpoints secured by Spring Security
		- for this, we must use Spring Security Test
	> since the annotation provides a mocked servlet environment, theres is NO PORT to access the application (e.g. RestTemplate)
		- therefore, you rather use the auto-configured MockMvc to access your endpoints


2. @DataJpaTest
	> used to test any JPA-related parts of your application
	> included in Spring Test Context
		@Repository, EntityManager, TestEntityManager, Datasource
	> not included
		@Service, @Component, @Controller beans
	> By default, this annotation tries to auto-configure use an embedded database (e.g., H2) as the DataSource


3. @SpringBootTest
	> used to write test against the whole application context
	> includes everything
