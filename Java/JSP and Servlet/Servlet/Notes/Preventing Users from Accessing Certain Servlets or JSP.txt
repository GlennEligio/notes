Preventing Users from Accessing Certain Servlets/JSP URL directly in browser

I. Adding Identifier in HttpSession of Client in Login
1. In Login, get the HttpSession of the Client request
	> use getSession of HttpServletRequest to create an HttpSession
2. In Login, after a SUCCESSFUL validation of client, add an attribute in HttpSession to uniquely identify the client
	> validate user if user exist in database	
	> preferrably, the attribute to be passed on session is a primary key in the database for Users

II. Checking for Identifier in HttpSession inside Servlet is that NOT ACCESSIBLE directly in url
3. Check for an HttpSession
	> for Servlet, we can create HttpSession by calling getSession() of HttpServletRequest
	> for JSP, we can use the "session" implicit object
4. Check if a specific attribute in the HttpSession is NOT NULL or PRESENT
	> use getAttribute("attribute-name") to HttpSession object
5. If NULL, redirect them to the home page
	> typically, the login page
