127 Beanstack Overview

Typical Architecture: Web App 3-tier 
 > 3-TIER architecture group consist of three components, the Presentation tier, the Application tier, and the Data tier
 > in this case, the Presentation tier will be the Elastic LoadBalancer(ELB), the Application tier will be the ASG (which contains the App instances), and the Data tier will be the ElastiCache + Amazon RDS

		(AutoScaling Group)
		|---> EC2 instance (AZ1) ---|---> ElastiCache 	
User ---> ELB --|---> EC2 instance (AZ2) ---|	(store/retrieve session+cache data)
		|---> EC2 instance (AZ3) ---|---> Amazon RDS
						(read/write data)


Developer problems on AWS
1. Managing infrastructure
2. Deploying Code
3. Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
4. Scaling concerns
5. Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
	> Application Loadbalancer + AutoScaling Group
6. All the developers want is for their code to run!
7. Possibly, consistently across different applications



AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview
 > Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
 > It uses all the component's we've seen before:
	- EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc
 > But it's all in one view that's easy to make sense of! 
 > We still have full control over the configuration
 > Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 > Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances


Elastic Beanstalk
 > Managed service
   - Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
   - Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
   - Capacity provisioning
   - Load balancing & auto-scaling
   - Application health-monitoring & responsiveness
 > Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer
 > Three architecture models
   1. Single instance deployment: good for developers
   2. LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
   3. ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc...)
 > Supports for many platforms
   - Go
   - Java SE
   - Java with Tomcat
   - .NET on Windows Server with IIS
   - Node.js
   - PHP
   - Python
   - Ruby
   - Packer Builder
   - Single Container Docker
   - Multi-Container Docker
   - Preconfigurated Docker
   - if not suppoerted, you can write your custom platform (advanced)



Elastic Beanstalk - Health Monitoring
 > Health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch
 > Checks for app health, publishes health events
