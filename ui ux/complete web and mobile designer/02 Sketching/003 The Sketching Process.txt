003 The Sketching Process

Sketching Process Steps
1. Be prepared!
	> prepare your tools beforehand
	> determine what your goals are
	> who is your audience
	> timebox yourself
		- determine how much time you spend for each thing like sketching, presentation, etc
2. Ready, Set ... Go!
	> Draw a frame for your device
	> Start with more simple and redundant elements...
		- use simple shapes like square, circle, rectangle
	> Move onto some more detailed interactions
	> Annotate your sketches and keep them safe
		- be as details as you can with annotations
		- save them so that we can revisit them later
	> Keep going
	> Share your sketches
		- their feedback can help improve your sketches and fix mistakes
3. Refinement
	> Add titles to your sketches
		- the provide context to the sketches, useful when you have many sketches
	> Add annotations tot he sketches again
		- important note is that update the annotations that you have in your current sketches
		- helps us explain stuff better
	> Use numbers
		- helps define where certain sketches within the flow/interactions is	
		- helps speed up discussions, and help others where a sketch fits in 
		- easier to point/specify the sketches (ex: sketch no.3)
	> Use arrows
		- helps indicate transitions (ex: using arrow to navigate viewer to the new sketch when a button is clicked)
	> Add gestures if you want
		- optional, we can indicate them in the sketch
		- though typically, we will directly communicate this to the developers
