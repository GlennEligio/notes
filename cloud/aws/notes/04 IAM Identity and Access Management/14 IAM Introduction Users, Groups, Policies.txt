14 IAM Introduction Users, Groups, Policies


IAM: Users & Groups
 > IAM stands for Identity and Access Management
 > a Global Service
 > Root account is created by default
	- this should not be used or shared
 > Users refers to people within your organization, which can be grouped
 > Groups refers to a User Group
	- can only contain users, not other groups
 > Users don't have to belong to a group
	- not a good practice
 > Users can belong to multiple group


EX:
Developers:
UserA, UserB

Operations:
UserC, UserD

Audit
UserB, UserC

No group:
UserE


IAM: Permission
 > reason why we use IAM with Users and Groups is to provision Permission to the AWS resources
 > Users and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called Policies
 > These Policies define the Permissions of the users
 > In AWS, you apply the Least Privilege Principle
	- Least Privilege Principle refers to giving the minimum permission to a user to do their job or needs
