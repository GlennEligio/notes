5 CORE CONCEPTS IN SPRING SECURITY

1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Principal
4. Granted Authority
5. Roles



1. Authentication
	> answers the question "Who are you?"
	> typically uses some user credentials to uniquely identify users
	> types of Authentication
		1. Knowledge Based Authentication	
		2. Possession based authentication
	> these types of authentication can be combined, creating whats known as MFA or Multi Factor Authentication

Knowledge Based Authentication
	> authentication based on knowledge that the user have
	> examples includes:
		1. Password
		2. Pin code
		3. Answer to a secret / personal question
	> Advantages includes:
		1. Easy to implement and use
	> Disvantages includes:
		1. Not fully safe
			- can be stolen and used to impersonate as you

Possession based authentication
	> tries to identify if you possess something that the REAL User should have
	> examples includes
		- Phone / Text messages
		- Key cards and badges
		- Access token device

MultiFactor Authentication
	> combination of two or more Authentications


2. Authorization
	> answers the question "Can this user do this?" 
	> need to Authenticate the User to determine what can it do

EX:
In a retail store, there are multiple roles:
	- Clerk
	- Manager
	- Store Manager
Each of these roles can access different parts of the system:
	> Clerk can access
		- inventory of the store
		- price of the store
	> Manager can access	
		- Department reports
	> Store Manager can access
		- Store reports



3. Principal
	> Currently logged in user
	> Person your identified through the process of Authentication
	
Ex: 
In Google, we can have multiple emails under a single person
But there's usually just one logged-in user (per request)
This logged in user is the principal.




4. Granted Authority
	> permissions defined and given to a specific authorities

EX:
In the retail store example earlier, the following roles have the permission to do the following
	> Store Clerk
		- do checkout
		- make store announcements
	> Department Manager
		- do checkout
		- make store announcements	
		- view department financials	
		- view department inventory
	> Store Manager
		- do checkout
		- make store announcements	
		- view department financials	
		- view department inventory
		- view store financials 




5. Role
	> group of authorities
		- authorities defines the actions that one can do
	> roles are   coarse-grained 

Ex:
In the retail store example we have earlier
	> role_store_clerk
		- do_checkout 
		- make_store_announcements
	> role_dept_mgr
		- do_checkout 
		- make_store_announcements
		- view_department_financials
		- view_department_inventory
	> role_store_mgr	
		- do_checkout 
		- make_store_announcements
		- view_department_financials
		- view_department_inventory
		- view_store_financials
