Scanner method
	> used to get input
	> we can pass an InputStream to its constructor
	> with it, it will "scan" the inputstream in console
	> need java.util.Scanner package in import
	

Scanner syntax
1. Defining scanner method
	Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in);
2. Defining variable for input being scanned
	String name = scannerName.next();


Some methods of the Scanner class
	
nextLine()
	> reads a line of text/characters in InputStream until it reaches a linebreak "\n" or ENTER and then return the said text

nextInt()
	> reads the characters in the InputStream until it reaches a linebreak "\n" then try to parse the text it read into Integer and returns it.



Process:
	1. After defining scanner method, the program will scan for input.
	2. After getting input, it will be assigned to variable assigned as scannerName.next()
