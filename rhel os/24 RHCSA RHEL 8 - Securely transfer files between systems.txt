24 RHCSA RHEL 8 - Securely transfer files between systems

Prerequisite for securely transferring files between systems
1. The must be under THE SAME NETWORK (or at least have communication with each other)
 	> for VMs, they must be in the same NAT Network


Commands
scp SOURCEFILE(S) USERNAME@IPADDR:TARGETDIR		-> copying files from current server to remote server
scp USERNAME@IPADDR:SOURCEFILE(S) TARGETDIR		-> copying files from remote server to current server
 > securely copy files
 > a remote file copy program
 > takes several inputs
	SOURCE	file or directory to copy
	USERNAME	one of the username on the other server
	IPADDR	ip address of the other server in the same network
	TARGETDIR	destination of the files on the other server
 > ex:
	$ scp file6 user1@10.0.2.5:tmp
		- will copy file6 to the server 10.0.2.5 under user1 USER and in the tmp file
	$ scp /etc/ssh/* user1@10.0.2.5:/tmp
		- copy everything under /etc/ssh to server 10.0.2.5 under user1 USER in the /tmp directory
	$ scp user1@10.0.2.4:/home/user1/Documents/fileToTransfer.txt /home/jglenn/Documents
		- copy the fileToTransfer.txt file in the remote server to the current server in specified directorys
 > NOTES:
	1. The destination directory must exist, if you want to paste the files selected to a directory to target server
	2. The user used in destination server will be the permission target used when we add/modify files in the dest. server.
		- ex: if we write to a file where only ROOT can write and we used "user1" when we transfer file (user1@10.0.2.4), then we will be denied
