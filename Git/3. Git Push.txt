GIT PUSH


I. Pushing to remote GitHub repository

1. Push the commits we made in local git repo to the GitHub repo
	> to do a push, use the following command

		git push origin master

	> the command consist of the following
		origin -> stands for the location of the remote repository
		master -> stands for the branch where we will push the commits



2. Check the GitHub repo to see the commits we added there
	> we can see the commit we made (the Added index.html commit) in the demo-repo in GitHub
	> also, if we look at the commit, we can see the following
		= -m text
		= the changes (addition, removal of lines)



II. Creating git repository locally

3. Create a new folder
	> name it demo-repo2
	> have it located in the same location as demo-repo



4. Add a README.md file inside it will some text

INSIDE README.md

# Demo 2

Some text.




5. Check if .git folder is inside the newly created demo-repo2
	> use the command 
		
		ls -Force
	
	> as we can see, theres no .git folder inside it



6. Initialize the local git repo for this folder
	> to do it, use

		git init

	> now, if we take a look at the contents of ls -Force, we will see a .git folder

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d--h--         10/7/2021   8:39 PM                .git
-a----         10/7/2021   8:39 PM             22 README.md



7. Add the README.md file in the local git repo
	> use git add . for adding
	> use git status to check the local git repo status



8. Commit the changes we made into the local git repo
	> use git commit to commit

		git commit -m "Created README" -m "description"



9. Try pushing the commits into the origin master
	> if we try it, we will get an error that states

		fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository



10. Create a new repository in our GitHub account for us to push the commits
	> have it the same name as the folder we have in local git (demo-repo2)



11. Copy the https or ssh link of the remote git repo that weve just made



12. Add the remote github repo link to our local git as the origin
	> use the command to do so

		git remote add origin <https-or-ssh-link>

	> in our case, it will be 

		git remote add origin git@github.com:GlennEligio/demo-repo2.git



13. Check the remote repositories we have in our local git
	> to check the remote repos we have, use the command

		git remote -v

	> the output should look like this

		origin  git@github.com:GlennEligio/demo-repo2.git (fetch)
		origin  git@github.com:GlennEligio/demo-repo2.git (push)



14. Lets now push the commits we have in local git repo to the remote git repo
	> use the same command as before

		git push origin master



15. Set an upstream in our local git
	> upstream means that it will be the default remote whenever we dont specify the remote git repo and the branch that whenever we push
	> to do this, we add a -u flag before we push on the remote git repo and branch that we want to be the upstream
	> for example, doing this

		git push -u origin main

	> this will make the origin main whenever we push and doesnt not provide the location. something like this

		git push
