30 Pets vs Cattle 


Common elements of Cloud Architecture
1. Decoupled from hardware resources
	> Consumers don't have to deal with these resources
2. Provides software control for these resources/services	
	> example includes Web UI or GUI
3. Comes with SLAs
	> SLA refers to Software Level Agreement which refers to the conditions Cloud Provider specifies that Consumers must agree
	> ex: AWS might mention in SLA that their EC2 instances are available 99.99% of the time


Pets vs Cattle analogy
 > analogy used to describe the decoupling from harware resources
 > Pets refers to how we deal with hardware resources ON-PREM
	- we typically are familiar with these resources intimately like a Pet, where we knows the specifics of it
	- ex: we know the name of the server, or which server rack and connection a specific server have
 > Cattle refers to how we deal with CLOUD hardware resources
	- here, you treat the resources as Cattle
	- you don't know any specifics with regards to the resources that you use (ex: server name, rack location, data center location)
	- we treat these resources as one among many rather than special thing
	- opposite of the snowflake server example given earlier
