	> is most often used to link to external style sheets

EX:

	> this will look at the mystyle.css and apply the settings in the file to the webpage



HTML <meta> element
	> typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
	> the metadata will NOT be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (to know how to display content or reload page), by search engines (for keywords), and other web services
	> metadata have the following attributes
		a. charset	- defines the character sets in browser
		b. name		- defines the "type" of meta data
				- this includes description, keywords, author, viewport, etc
		c. content	- defines the characteristic of the metadata "type"

EX:

Viewport
	> user's visible area of a web page
	> varies from devices to devices
	> smaller on mobile phone than on a computer screen
	> because of this, we should take this into account when designing the webpage

EX:

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

		 the name="viewport" 

	>defines that the metadata is related to viewport

		content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"

	>defines that the webpage's width will be equal to device's width and the initial scale will be 1.0





HTML <script> element
	> used to define client-side JavaScript
	> JavaScript is used to write back-end functions for the webpage

EX:

<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
}
</script>

	> this JavaScript writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo"




HTML <base> element
	> specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page
	> <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both
	> there can only be one SINGLE <base> element in a document

EX: 

<head>
<base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
</head>

<body>
<img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman">
<a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a>
</body>

	> with this, the src of the img element will be have the href of the base added before it

		"https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif"

	> also, in the href of linktag, the base href will be added before its href

		"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp"

	> as for the target of the href, even if theres no target specified in the linktag, the target of the base element will be its target attribute
