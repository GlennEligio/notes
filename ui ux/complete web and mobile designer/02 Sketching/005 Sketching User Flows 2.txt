005 Sketching User Flows 2

GOAL: Screen flow

Screen flow
 > more focused on the user's action through a specific flow
 > it could be a specific sequence of screens or it could be a journey that branches

STEPS: User searching for product user flow
1. Search page frame
	> contains search bar, and some home buttons at the bottom bar
2. Result search frame/page
	> contains the search bar as well, and the list of the search result items
	> search result item may be present in a card format, where theres a thumbnail at the left and information text at right
	> information include name, price, ratings, etc
3. Product description frame
	> contains the following
		- product image, enlarged (can be a carousel)
		- product name, price, rating
		- product options like colors
		- additional description
		- button for adding to cart
4. Cart page
	> contains the list of items
	> also with regards to page hierarchy, we should put most used buttons in the easy access area (back button should be sticky button)


Alternate Route
1. Home page
	> in this page, we may display products that might navigate the user directly to the item description page


NOTE:
1. We must take account of ALL USER FLOW when it comes to building user journeys
