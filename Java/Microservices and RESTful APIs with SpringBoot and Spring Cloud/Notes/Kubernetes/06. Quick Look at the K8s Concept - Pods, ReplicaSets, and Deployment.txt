06. Quick Look at the K8s Concept - Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployment


kubectl get events
	> similar to getting events in Docker
	> events includes
		- scheduling, creating, starting, killing K8s resource like
			-> Pods/Nodes/Deployment/ReplicaSet/Service/Volume/ etc
		- scaling ReplicaSet/Deployment

kubectl get <resource-type>
	> general command in K8s to fetch specific resource
	> these resources include
		- pod
		- deployment
		- replicaset
		- volume
		- service
		- network
		- secret
		- namespace
		- node
	> we can use either the plural or singular form of the resource type
		- ex: kubectl get pods or kubectl get pod


Pods
	> smallest unit in K8s cluster
	> each Pod can contain one or more Containers running inside



Single Responsibility Principle
	> K8s uses Single Responsibility principle
	> In this principle, one Concept will have one Responsibility
